Foundation Objects Support Confirmation\\nThe documentation confirms that Employee Central manages DOE organizational design via Foundation Objects supporting:\\n- **Organizational Structure**: departments, divisions, regions, schools/centres, offices, branches, business units\\n- **Job Structure**: jobs, positions, job classifications, codes, families, functions, roles\\n- **Pay Structure**: cost centres\\n- **Location Structure**: locations, geographical data\\n\\n### 2. Configuration Capabilities\\n- Supports up to **six hierarchy levels** for organizational structure\\n- Includes **cost centre management** and **reporting relationships**\\n- Provides **validity periods** for historical tracking\\n- Structures are categorized into Organizational, Job, Pay, and Location categories\\n\\n### 3. Critical Gaps Identified\\n\\n**High Severity Issues (Blocking)**:\\n- No explicit mapping of all object validity periods confirmed\\n- Missing confirmation of attribute coverage for all object types\\n- Evidence gap: \\\"No explicit mapping of all object validity periods\\\"\\n\\n### 4. Recommended Actions to Address Gaps\\n\\n**Immediate Actions Required**:\\n1. **Configuration Workbook Review**: Verify Configuration Workbook–Employee Central for complete attribute mapping\\n2. **Integration Specification Analysis**: Review Integration Spec–EC to CIS for object-to-Foundation mapping\\n3. **Organizational Structure Specification**: Examine Org Structure Spec for hierarchy level definitions\\n\\n**Validation Steps**:\\n1. **System Administrator Consultation**: Engage EC Architect to verify configuration options for all specified object types\\n2. **Sample Data Testing**: Examine organizational charts and position management screens\\n3. **Demonstration Request**: Obtain screenshots of creation, editing, and deactivation processes\\n4. **Audit Trail Verification**: Review change history capabilities for historical tracking\\n\\n### 5. Priority Recommendations\\n\\n**Phase: Realize–Design** (Due immediately)\\n- **Owner**: EC Architect\\n- **Blocking Issue**: Must resolve before proceeding\\n- **Required Artifacts**: Configuration Workbook, Integration Specifications, Foundation Object Specifications\\n\\nThe documentation confirms the capability exists but lacks the detailed mapping and validation required for implementation.
