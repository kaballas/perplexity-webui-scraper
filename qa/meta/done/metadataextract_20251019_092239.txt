## HCMS Organisation Design Requirements Analysis

### Executive Summary
This metadata extraction analyzes the 38 functional requirements for the Queensland Department of Education's HCMS Organisation Design module, identifying technical metadata implications, system capabilities, and implementation considerations for SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central.

## 1. Core Metadata Framework Analysis

### 1.1 Organisational Structure Foundation Objects
```
Entity: Foundation Object (FO)
- FOCompany: Department/organisation entities
- FODivision: Divisional structures  
- FOBusinessUnit: Business unit management
- FODepartment: Departmental structures
- FOCompanyLocation: Location/centre entities
- FOCostCenter: Cost centre integration
- FOJobCode: Job architecture framework
- FOPosition: Position management objects
```

### 1.2 Custom MDF Objects Required
```
Object: OrganizationUnit (Cust_MDF)
- Fields: OrgUnitID, OrgUnitTitle, OrgUnitType, Status, HeadPositionID
- Temporal: effectiveStartDate, effectiveEndDate
- Attributes: CostCentre, Location, TransferRating, OrgUnitType

Object: PositionManagement (Cust_MDF) 
- Fields: PositionID, PositionTitle, LocallyKnownAs, JobProfile, ReportsTo
- Attributes: SupervisorPosition, DirectReports, BudgetedFTE, ActualFTE
- Temporal: startDate, endDate, effectiveDate
```

## 2. Technical Metadata Considerations

### 2.1 Temporal Data Management Requirements
**Metadata Implications:**
- All organizational objects require effective dating support
- Historical data retention for past/current/future scenarios (FR-8)
- Concurrent employment tracking capabilities
- Retroactive change management

**OData Entity Sets:**
```
EmploymentInfo: employmentStatus, startDate, endDate
JobInfo: position, jobCode, employmentType, assignmentId
OrgUnitInfo: orgUnitId, orgUnitType, effectiveStartDate/EndDate
PositionInfo: positionId, positionTitle, budgetedFTE, actualFTE
```

### 2.2 Hierarchical Structure Metadata
**Object Relationships:**
```
OrgUnit Hierarchy:
- ParentOrgUnitID (association to self)
- ChildOrgUnits (collection)
- HierarchyLevel (integer)
- Path (string for navigation)

Position-to-OrgUnit Association:
- Position.orgUnitId → OrgUnit.externalCode
- Position.jobCode → JobCode.externalCode
- Position.locationId → Location.externalCode
```

### 2.3 Integration Metadata (CIS Integration - FR-4)
**Required API Endpoints:**
```
OData Services:
- /odata/v2/FOCompany
- /odata/v2/OrganizationUnit
- /odata/v2/Position
- /odata/v2/JobInfo
- /odata/v2/Location

Integration Objects:
- CIS_OrgUnit_Inbound
- CIS_Position_Inbound  
- CIS_Job_Inbound
```

## 3. Potential Design and Implementation Issues

### 3.1 Technical Challenges

**A. Concurrent Employment Complexity (FR-20, FR-31)**
```
Metadata Issue: Standard EC doesn't natively support concurrent employment
Required Customization:
- Custom MDF object for concurrent assignment tracking
- Modified JobInfo schema to support multiple assignments per employee
- Enhanced workflow for concurrent position management
- Custom payroll integration logic for split FTE calculations
```

**B. FTE Management and Validation (FR-17, FR-24-26)**
```
Metadata Requirements:
- Real-time FTE calculation fields on OrgUnit objects
- Hierarchical FTE aggregation logic
- Custom validation rules for FTE cap enforcement
- Position-based FTE inheritance mechanisms
```

**C. Bulk Operations Performance (FR-21, FR-22)**
```
Technical Considerations:
- OData batch operation limits (typically 1000 records)
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Transaction management for bulk operations
- Error handling and partial success scenarios
```

### 3.2 Operational Challenges

**A. Workflow Integration (FR-28)**
```
Workflow Metadata:
- Approval processes for permanent/SES positions
- Role-based routing (JADE, Finance teams)
- Conditional workflow triggers
- Escalation and timeout mechanisms
```

**B. Position-Based Allowances (FR-32)**
```
Payroll Integration Metadata:
- Infotype 220 (Pension Scheme Benefits) extensions
- Position-based pay component assignments
- Real-time allowance calculation triggers
- Integration with ECP for payroll processing
```

### 3.3 Compliance and Governance Issues

**A. Data Retention and Audit (FR-38)**
```
Audit Trail Requirements:
- Change history for all organizational objects
- User action logging for compliance
- Data lineage tracking for reporting
- GDPR/privacy compliance for location data
```

**B. External Mappings (FR-10)**
```
Metadata for ANZSCO Integration:
- ANZSCO Code external reference fields
- External mapping tables for job classifications
- Validation rules for ANZSCO code compliance
- Integration endpoints for external reference data
```

## 4. Custom Field and Extension Requirements

### 4.1 Organizational Unit Extensions
```
Custom Fields (OrgUnit MDF):
- transferRating (picklist)
- certifiedAgreement (picklist)
- maxFTEAllocation (decimal)
- vacancyManagementEnabled (boolean)
```

### 4.2 Position Management Extensions
```
Custom Fields (Position MDF):
- locallyKnownAs (string)
- identifiedPosition (boolean)
- fundingType (picklist)
- hrDelegationLevel (picklist)
- financeDelegationLevel (picklist)
```

### 4.3 Location-Specific Extensions
```
Custom Fields (Location MDF):
- latitude (decimal)
- longitude (decimal)
- remoteLocationFlag (boolean)
- locationBasedAllowanceEligible (boolean)
```

## 5. Integration Mapping Metadata

### 5.1 EC to ECP Integration
```
Entity Mappings:
- Position → Payroll Infotype 0007 (Planned Compensation)
- JobCode → Payroll Classification
- Location → Payroll Location Codes
- CostCenter → Payroll Cost Distribution
```

### 5.2 CIS Integration Schema
```
Inbound Fields:
- CIS_OrgUnitID → OrgUnit.externalCode
- CIS_LocationCode → Location.externalCode
- CIS_CostCentre → CostCenter.externalCode
- CIS_BudgetedFTE → Position.budgetedFTE
```

## 6. Reporting and Analytics Metadata

### 6.1 Organizational Reporting Entities
```
Report Objects:
- OrgStructureReport: Hierarchical org chart data
- VacancyReport: Position vacancy status and metrics
- FTEReport: Headcount and FTE analytics
- EstablishmentReport: Organizational establishment data
```

### 6.2 Custom Report Definitions
```
Report Schema:
- OrgHierarchy: Parent-child relationships
- PositionOccupancy: Employee-position assignments
- FTEAggregation: FTE calculations by organizational level
- ConcurrentEmployment: Multiple position assignments per employee
```

## 7. Security and Permission Metadata

### 7.1 Role-Based Permissions
```
Permission Groups:
- ORG_DESIGN_ADMIN: Full organizational design access
- LINE_MANAGER: Position creation/edit for assigned units
- JADE_TEAM: Job analysis and design permissions
- FINANCE_APPROVER: Financial approval workflows
- REPORT_VIEWER: Organizational reporting access
```

### 7.2 Field-Level Security
```
Security Metadata:

4. **Establish bulk operation frameworks** with proper error handling

### 8.2 Integration Architecture
1. **Design CIS integration** with proper data transformation and validation
2. **Implement EC-ECP integration** for position-based allowance processing
3. **Create external mapping services** for ANZSCO and other reference data

### 8.3 Governance and Compliance
1. **Establish audit trail mechanisms** for all organizational changes
2. **Implement data retention policies** for historical organizational data
3. **Create compliance reporting** for regulatory requirements
