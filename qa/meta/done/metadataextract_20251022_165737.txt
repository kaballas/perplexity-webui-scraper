# Structured Notes: Queensland Department of Education Salary Increment System

## 1. Document Scope and Section Hierarchy

### Primary Focus
- **System**: SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll (ECP)
- **Function**: Custom salary increment management for Queensland DoE
- **Replacement**: Current TSS system

### Document Structure
- **Technical Architecture**: Custom infotypes, tables, processing programs
- **Business Rules**: Service calculation, conditional progressions, award classifications
- **Integration Requirements**: ECP-EC synchronization, BTP orchestration
- **Risk Management**: Data migration, performance, compliance

## 2. Key Entities, Systems, and Components

### Core Systems
- **Source System**: TSS (current)
- **Target System**: SAP SuccessFactors ECP
- **Integration Platform**: BTP (Business Technology Platform)

### Custom Infrastructure Components
- **IT9000**: Primary increment management infotype
- **ZPI_RULES**: Increment rule definitions
- **ZPI_RULE_STEPS**: Processing sequence definitions  
- **ZPI_RULE_AWARD**: Award-to-rule mappings
- **ZPI_CC**: Cross-counting service rules
- **ZPI_LWOP**: Leave without pay rules

### Business Entities
- **Employee Cohorts**: Permanent teachers, temporary teachers, casual employees
- **Award Classifications**: Different service calculation methods
- **Service Types**: Calendar days, school days (200 ≈ 1 year), hours (1,200 minimum)

## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### System Dependencies
```
ECP (Payroll) ←→ EC (Employee Central) ←→ BTP (Orchestration)
     ↓              ↓
Custom Infotypes ←→ MDF Objects
```

### Data Flow Dependencies
- **Historical Data Migration** → Continuity of increment calculations
- **Conditional Requirements** → APR/qualification systems
- **Award Changes** → Enterprise bargaining outcomes
- **Leave Processing** → Service accumulation accuracy

### Processing Dependencies
- **Fortnightly Calculations** → Real-time synchronization
- **Multi-tasking Support** → Performance requirements
- **Notification System** → 3-month advance alerts

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Primary Processing Flow
1. **Data Input**: Employee service data, leave records, award classifications
2. **Rule Processing**: ZPI_RULES → ZPI_RULE_STEPS execution
3. **Service Calculation**: Calendar/school/hour-based accumulation
4. **Cross-counting**: ZPI_CC rule application
5. **Increment Determination**: Conditional/automatic progression
6. **Output Generation**: IT9000 updates, notifications, EC synchronization

### Integration Flow
- **Source**: EC employee data via OData APIs
- **Processing**: ECP custom infotypes and business rules
- **Synchronization**: BTP-mediated EC-MDF object updates
- **Output**: Payroll integration and notification delivery

### Error Handling Flow
- **Exception Detection**: Validation against ZPI_RULES
- **Manual Override**: Human intervention for conditional requirements
- **Audit Logging**: Compliance tracking and troubleshooting
- **Recovery Processing**: Error correction and reprocessing

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Technical Accuracy Verification
- **Custom Extension Architecture**: Confirmed through multiple contexts showing MDF portlets, OData APIs, RBPM integration
- **Performance Requirements**: Validated by high-severity risk documentation for real-time calculation performance
- **Integration Complexity**: Supported by ECP to EC integration specifications

### Business Rule Validation
- **Service Calculation Methods**: Confirmed across contexts (calendar days, school days, hours)
- **Conditional Progressions**: Verified through notification and approval workflow requirements
- **Award Complexity**: Validated by EBA (Enterprise Bargaining Agreement) references

### Risk Assessment Validation
- **Data Migration**: Confirmed as critical gap in cutover planning
- **Performance**: Validated by high-severity performance risk documentation
- **Compliance**: Confirmed through audit logging and service calculation complexity

### Traceability Matrix
| Requirement | Source Document | Validation Status |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Custom Infotypes | Context 0, 2, 3 | ✅ Confirmed |
| Real-time Performance | Context 1 | ✅ High Risk Validated |
| ECP-EC Integration | Context 2, 3 | ✅ Confirmed |
| Service Calculation Rules | Context 0, 2 | ✅ Confirmed |
| Conditional Progressions | Context 0 | ✅ Confirmed |
| Data Migration Strategy | Context 0 | ⚠️ Gap Identified |
