## Key Information to Extract for Enhanced Context Understanding

### **User Role and Authority Level**
- **Primary Role**: Solution Architect/Technical Lead for Queensland DoE HCMS Programme
- **Decision Authority**: High-level technical decision maker for $X million SAP SuccessFactors implementation
- **Stakeholder Management**: Multi-level engagement (teachers, principals, HR, payroll, IT operations)

### **Implementation Phase and Timeline**
- **Current Phase**: Explore Phase (requirements validation and solution design)
- **Project Timeline**: Multi-year implementation with critical go-live dependencies
- **Urgency Level**: High - needs immediate technical feasibility validation

### **Technical Constraints and Requirements**
- **Scale Requirements**: 100K+ concurrent users with 40K+ peak load during Christmas break
- **Performance SLA**: <3 second response times under extreme load conditions
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple legacy systems (OneSchool, QSuper/ART, WorkCover Queensland)
- **Compliance Requirements**: Australian government standards (IS18:2018, IPOLA, ACSC guidance)

### **Risk Tolerance and Validation Needs**
- **Risk Appetite**: Low - cannot afford system failure during peak periods
- **Validation Approach**: Source-backed verification required before proceeding
- **Custom vs Standard**: Preference for standard SuccessFactors configuration over custom development
- **Proof of Concept**: Needs immediate feasibility assessment before full commitment

### **Knowledge Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention**
- **Multi-Assignment Feasibility**: Uncertainty about native SuccessFactors Time Off capabilities
- **Performance Architecture**: Concerns about scaling under 40K+ concurrent users
- **Integration Patterns**: Need for specific technical approaches for Queensland-specific systems
- **Academic Calendar Support**: Validation of term-based accrual capabilities

### **Success Criteria and Dependencies**
- **Success Metrics**: User adoption, performance benchmarks, stakeholder satisfaction
- **Critical Dependencies**: External system integration, performance testing, stakeholder buy-in
- **Failure Consequences**: Operational disruption for 100K+ educators, potential impact on school operations

### **Communication and Decision-Making Style**
- **Preferred Format**: Structured, evidence-backed analysis with clear verdicts
- **Decision Framework**: Risk-averse with emphasis on technical feasibility
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Needs clear, source-validated information for executive presentations
- **Validation Requirements**: Demands official documentation and peer-reviewed sources before proceeding
