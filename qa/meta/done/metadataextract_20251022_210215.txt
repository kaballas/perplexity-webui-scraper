# Key Information Gaps for Enhanced Context

## Integration Architecture Requirements
- **Data Governance Strategy**: Golden record approach with HR RG (Microsoft Fabric) as single source of truth, BTP as read-only cache
- **Synchronization Mechanism**: Event-driven sync using SAP Event Mesh between HR RG and BTP custom tables
- **Change Management**: SAP Solution Manager integration for BTP extensions following same governance as core SuccessFactors modules
- **Transport Management**: TMS integration for BTP application releases alongside SuccessFactors modules

## Business Logic Complexity
- **Concurrent Assignment Handling**: Employee-level logic with assignment-level granularity for award changes
- **Cross-Assignment Balance Management**: Pro-rated conversion rules when only some assignments change
- **Multi-Assignment Performance**: Bulk API calls vs individual assignment queries for employees with 5-10+ concurrent assignments
- **Temporal Consistency**: Locking mechanisms and status indicators during award conversion processes

## Performance & Scalability Specifications
- **Response Time SLA**: <3 seconds for employee-level aggregated view
- **Caching Strategy**: 15-minute TTL with on-demand refresh for assignment-level balances
- **Load Testing Requirements**: Scenarios with 5-10 concurrent assignments per employee
- **API Optimization**: Bulk call implementation instead of individual queries

## Compliance & Security Requirements
- **Data Residency**: BTP applications configured in Australian regions only (Sydney/Melbourne)
- **IS18:2018 Compliance**: Data classification, encryption at rest/transit, access logging requirements
- **Microsoft Purview Integration**: Metadata tagging for governance framework connection
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Comprehensive logging with user context and provenance tracking

## Error Handling & Recovery
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: For SuccessFactors API call management
- **Fallback Strategies**: Cached data serving with stale data indicators during API outages
- **Atomic Operations**: Database transaction implementation for award conversions
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automatic state reversion on conversion failures

## Queensland DoE Specific Requirements
- **Academic Calendar Integration**: School holiday restrictions, term-based leave planning, teacher-specific patterns
- **12-Month Projection Logic**: Business rule alignment with calendar year cycles vs. technical limitations
- **Cutover Strategy**: Phased migration by employee category with parallel processing capability
- **Historical Balance Validation**: Cross-validation protocols for 100K+ employee transition

## Downstream System Integration
- **Data Flow Architecture**: Complete chain from HR RG → SuccessFactors → BTP → ECP → CIS/IAM/Alloc8/SBS/OneSchool
- **Real-time vs Batch Definitions**: System-specific update requirements and validation gates
- **Data Quality Protocols**: Validation before downstream system pushes
- **Monitoring Requirements**: End-to-end data flow health tracking

## Operational & Governance Framework
- **Testing Standards**: Unit, integration, UAT following SuccessFactors module standards
- **Documentation Requirements**: SAP SolDoc integration with business requirement traceability
- **Incident Response**: Monitoring, alerting, and operational procedures
- **User Access Control**: Role-based governance with administrative override capabilities
