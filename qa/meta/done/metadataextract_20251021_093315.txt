## 2. Key Entities, Systems, and Components

### Core Systems
- **Legacy System**: TSS (COBOL/Oracle - 28 years old)
- **New SAP Platform**: SuccessFactors (EC, ECP, Recruiting, Onboarding 2.0), Fieldglass, Build Apps, Signavio
- **New Azure Platform**: Microsoft Fabric-based HR Resource Group (HR RG)

### Foundational Pillars

#### SAP Platform Components
- **SuccessFactors Modules**:
  - Employee Central (EC) - Core HR data
  - Employee Central Payroll (ECP) - Payroll processing
  - Recruiting and Onboarding 2.0
- **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)**:
  - Identity Authentication Service (IAS)
  - Identity Provisioning Service (IPS)
  - Workflow Management and Extensibility
  - Event Mesh for event-driven architecture
- **Integration Suite**: Cloud Platform Integration (CPI) and Integration Catalog (IC)
- **Data Sphere**: Semantic modeling and data harmonization
- **ALM**: Application Lifecycle Management for Parallel Payroll Run Testing (PPRT)
- **Extensions and Tools**:
  - Fieldglass (contingent workforce)
  - Build Apps (low-code development)
  - Signavio (process modeling)
  - Joule (AI assistant)
  - WalkMe (user guidance)
- **Content & Records Management**:
  - OpenText xECM for SAP SuccessFactors
  - OpenText InfoArchive for long-term retention

#### Azure/Microsoft Fabric Components
- **HR Resource Group (HR RG)**: Master data and golden record repository
- **Microsoft Fabric**: Unified analytics platform with Medallion Architecture
- **Azure Data Hub**: Data ingestion and processing engine
- **Azure DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline management and test automation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for consistent provisioning
- **Data Governance**: Microsoft Purview for lineage and classification
- **Security Monitoring**: Splunk (current) / Microsoft Sentinel (future)

### Supporting Components
- **Enterprise Data Platform (EDP)** under EQIP Program
- **46+ downstream systems** (CIS, IAM, Alloc8, SBS, OneSchool, etc.)
- **OpenText xECM** for SAP SuccessFactors document management
- **OpenText InfoArchive** for long-term retention (Azure-hosted)
- **Azure DevOps and SAP ALM** for unified lifecycle governance

## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### Primary Relationships
- **SAP ↔ Azure Integration**: SAP Integration Suite bridges to Microsoft Fabric
- **HR RG as Central Hub**: Acts as authoritative data source to EDP and 46+ downstream systems
- **Data Flow**: SAP Data Sphere → HR RG → Downstream systems

### Dependency Matrix
```
SAP SuccessFactors → SAP Data Sphere → HR RG → EDP/Downstream Systems
SAP Integration Suite ↔ Azure Data Hub
SAP ALM ↔ Azure DevOps (unified DevOps model)
```

### Critical Dependencies
- **Identity Management**: Ping Federation/Entra ID integration with SAP IAS/IPS
- **Security**: Queensland Government IS18:2018 and IPOLA compliance
- **Document Management**: OpenText xECM ↔ SAP SuccessFactors, InfoArchive for archiving
- **DevOps Integration**: Unified pipeline across SAP and Azure platforms

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Source Systems → SAP Data Sphere → HR RG (Medallion: Bronze/Silver/Gold) → Downstream Systems
```

### Integration Patterns
- **API-based integration** via SAP Integration Suite (CPI/IC)
- **Real-time and batch processing** capabilities
- **Medallion Architecture** implementation (bronze: raw, silver: cleansed, gold: business-ready)
- **Azure DataHub** ingestion engine for data flows

### Cutover Strategy Flow
1. **Phase 1**: TSS → HR RG data migration
2. **Phase 2**: Downstream systems transition from TSS to HR RG
3. **Phase 3**: SAP operational systems go-live

### Testing Flow
- **Parallel Payroll Run Testing (PPRT)**: TSS vs SAP ECP comparison
- **End-to-end reconciliation**: payslips, deductions, leave balances, GL entries, ATO submissions
- **SAP ALM** manages PPRT linkage to Azure DevOps

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Validation Points
- **Proof of Concept Success**:
  - 1,000 employee records ingested from TSS to HR RG
  - 3,000+ tables ingested from TSS to Fabric
  - Confirmed viability of Azure DevOps + Terraform approach

### Traceability Framework
- **SAP ALM ↔ Azure DevOps** integration for unified lifecycle management
- **End-to-end test traceability** across both platforms
- **Defect tracking** linked between systems
- **Configuration management** across environments (Production, Pre-Production, Test, Development)

### Compliance Validation
- **Queensland Government IS18:2018** alignment
- **IPOLA Act 2023** compliance
- **QGEA-aligned security frameworks**
- **Microsoft Purview** for data governance and lineage

### Environment Structure
- **SAP Environments**: Production, Pre-Production (UAT), Training, Development (CMDEV)
- **Azure Environments**: Production, Pre-Production, Test, Development
- **Integration**: Single Sign-On (SSO) across all environments
- **Change Management**: DoE Change Advisory Board (CAB) oversight
