## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies
- **Employee Central** serves as foundation feeding all connected modules
- **Bi-directional flows** between Employee Central and satellite modules
- **Process chains** enabling end-to-end workflows (Fieldglass → Recruiting → Succession)

### Data Flow Dependencies
- Job requisitions flow from contingent worker needs to full recruiting
- Seamless hire process from Recruiting → Onboarding → People and Transaction → Employee Central
- Time Management exchanges data with Employee Central for attendance/time-off
- Payroll integration with recalculation capabilities from Time Management

### Integration Dependencies
- **High severity**: Payroll integration points (blocking dependency)
- **Medium severity**: Concurrent employment workflow configurations
- **Integration dependency**: Payroll integration with external systems

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Primary Data Flows
```
SAP Fieldglass → Recruiting → Onboarding → People/Transaction → Employee Central
```

### Integration Patterns
- **Bi-directional synchronization** between Employee Central and satellite modules
- **Real-time data synchronization** across all connected systems
- **Automated calculations** in Payroll and Variable Pay modules
- **End-to-end talent workflows** through process chains

### Technical Capabilities
- **Seamless hire processes** with immediate employee visibility
- **Auto-assignment** of employees to collaborative offers in Work Zone
- **Holistic workforce reporting** generation
- **Recalculation capabilities** from Time Management to Payroll

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Architecture Validation Points
- **Single source of truth** maintained through Employee Central
- **Unified workforce view** across all connected modules
- **Real-time synchronization** ensuring data consistency
- **End-to-end process coverage** from requisition through retirement

### Traceability Elements
- **Master data** consolidation in Work Zone
- **Talent data** integration with master data for unified visibility
- **Transaction tracking** across all modules
- **Process chain** validation from requisition to completion
