# Procedure for Extracting, Structuring, and Condensing HCMS Technical Overview Notes

## Step 1: Document Scope and Section Hierarchy Analysis
- **Review all available HCMS documents** to identify the complete technical overview scope
- **Map document relationships** and version hierarchies using metadata timestamps
- **Establish section boundaries** by identifying:
  - Introduction and program structure (Phase 1 and Phase 2)
  - Technical architecture components
  - Integration patterns and dependencies
  - Supporting documentation requirements
- **Create document cross-reference matrix** to ensure no information gaps exist

## Step 2: Key Entities, Systems, and Components Extraction
- **Identify core technical components**:
  - SAP's cloud-based Human Experience Management capabilities
  - Microsoft Azure data integration and transformation services
  - Hybrid architecture framework
- **Extract system-level entities**:
  - HCMS Program phases and structure
  - Technical architecture stakeholders (ChangeMgmt, AnswerQuestions, MetadataExtract, QualityAssurance)
  - Required technical documentation artifacts
- **Catalog supporting elements**:
  - Integration blueprints
  - Security frameworks
  - Data governance strategies
  - Configuration workbooks

## Step 3: Relationship and Dependency Mapping
- **Map architectural dependencies**:
  - SAP cloud services → Azure integration services
  - Technical architecture → Implementation phases
  - Current state → Future state transitions
- **Identify process dependencies**:
  - Design workshops → Service catalog development
  - Process optimization → Platform implementation
  - Support model transitions → Go-live preparation
- **Document stakeholder dependencies**:
  - Solution Architect → Integration Lead coordination
  - Security SME → Compliance framework development

## Step 4: Technical Flows and Integrations Summary
- **Chart data flow patterns**:
  - Integration architecture blueprints
  - Data transformation processes
  - System-to-system communication paths
- **Document technical integration points**:
  - SAP-Azure connectivity requirements
  - API and data exchange protocols
  - Security and compliance integration touchpoints
- **Map implementation workflow**:
  - Design phase → Realize phase transitions
  - Current state analysis → Future state design
  - Transition planning → Go-live execution

## Step 5: Accuracy Validation and Traceability Preservation
- **Cross-reference information** across all source documents to ensure consistency
- **Validate technical architecture** alignment with stated hybrid model
- **Verify phase structure** matches documented two-phase approach
- **Maintain document traceability** by preserving source document metadata and timestamps
- **Confirm completeness** against the required technical documentation set identified in critical architecture documents

## Step 6: Structured Summary Output Generation
- **Organize content under hierarchical headings**:
  
### **HCMS Program Structure**
- Two-phase implementation approach
- Figure 1 reference (program phases illustration)

### **Technical Architecture Overview**
- Hybrid architecture model
- SAP cloud-based Human Experience Management
- Microsoft Azure data integration and transformation services

### **Required Technical Documentation**
- Integration Architecture Blueprint
- Security Architecture and Compliance Framework
- Data Governance and Master Data Management Strategy
- System Configuration Workbook
- DevOps Framework

### **Stakeholder and Process Framework**
- Change Management approach
- Technical Implementation focus areas
- Quality Assurance validation requirements
- Comprehensive documentation standards

- **Format content using bullet hierarchy** with primary, secondary, and tertiary levels as appropriate
- **Ensure clarity** by maintaining technical precision while avoiding ambiguity
- **Preserve completeness** by including all identified components, relationships, and dependencies
- **Deliver structured notes** that support both technical implementation and process design requirements
