## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies
- **Employee Central** → feeds data to all connected modules
- **Data Flow Direction**: Bi-directional between Employee Central and satellite modules
- **Process Chain Dependencies**: Fieldglass → Recruiting → Succession

### Critical Relationships
- **Master Data Consistency**: Employee Central maintains data consistency across all touchpoints
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Bi-directional flows ensure current data states
- **End-to-end Workflows**: Process chains enable complete talent management cycles

### Integration Dependencies
- **Time Management ↔ Employee Central**: Time off and attendance exchange
- **Payroll ↔ Time Management**: Recalculation capabilities
- **Work Zone ↔ All Modules**: Master and talent data consolidation

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Primary Data Flows
- **Job Requisition Flow**: SAP Fieldglass → Recruiting (contingent worker needs to full recruiting)
- **Hire Process Flow**: Recruiting → Onboarding → People and Transaction → Employee Central
- **Performance Data Flow**: Organization Management → Competence ratings by job/position
- **Compensation Flow**: Salary Information → Compensation processes

### Integration Patterns
- **Bi-directional Synchronization**: Real-time data consistency between Employee Central and satellite modules
- **Process Chain Execution**: End-to-end talent workflows (Fieldglass → Recruiting → Succession)
- **Data Consolidation**: Work Zone combines master and talent data for unified visibility
- **Automated Calculations**: Payroll and Variable Pay reduce manual intervention

### Technical Capabilities
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensures current data across all modules
- **Auto-assignment**: Work Zone automatically assigns employees to collaborative offers
- **Transaction Tracking**: Analytics module tracks all system transactions
- **Recalculation**: Payroll system with dynamic recalculation from Time Management

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Architectural Validations
- **Single Source of Truth**: Employee Central confirmed as central data repository
- **Integration Completeness**: All major HR processes covered from requisition to retirement
- **Data Consistency**: Mechanisms in place to maintain consistency across touchpoints

### Traceability Elements
- **Implementation Phases**: Clear distinction between current (blue) and future (purple) modules
- **Module Progression**: Logical flow from basic to advanced functionality
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear relationships between core and satellite modules
