# Key Information Gaps for Enhanced Context

## Missing Technical Specifications

### Integration Architecture Details
- **Current Claims Portal technical specifications** - API endpoints, data models, authentication methods, and business logic implementation
- **SuccessFactors OData API configuration details** - specific endpoint capabilities, rate limits, authentication flows, and real-time performance characteristics
- **ECP integration specifications** - available BAPIs for time entry processing, cost assignment APIs, and batch vs real-time processing capabilities

### Award Interpretation System
- **Complete award rule definitions** - all possible award classifications, rate structures, overtime calculations, and boundary conditions for Queensland DoE
- **Historical award data requirements** - 12-month retroactive capability specifications, rate change tracking, and version management
- **Concurrent employment business rules** - how multiple assignments/roles on same day are handled, cost center allocation rules

## Missing Business Process Information

### User Workflow Requirements
- **Business Development Manager daily workflows** - step-by-step processes, decision points, exception handling, and approval hierarchies
- **Emergency coverage scenarios** - last-minute substitutions, temporary assignments, and rapid time entry requirements
- **Multi-location work patterns** - employees working at multiple schools in single day, cost allocation between locations

### Compliance and Audit Requirements
- **Payroll compliance specifications** - audit trail requirements, regulatory reporting needs, and compliance validation rules
- **Data retention policies** - how long time entries must be maintained, backup requirements, and archival procedures
- **Error correction processes** - how payroll errors are identified, corrected, and reconciled

## Missing System Performance Requirements

### Scalability Specifications
- **Peak usage patterns** - concurrent user loads during pay period closes, end-of-term processing, and holiday periods
- **Performance benchmarks** - acceptable response times for employee lookup, time entry validation, and approval workflows
- **System availability requirements** - uptime SLAs during critical payroll periods and disaster recovery procedures

### Data Volume Requirements
- **Historical data scope** - volume of data to be migrated, retention periods, and access frequency patterns
- **Integration frequency** - how often data syncs between systems, real-time vs batch processing requirements
- **Backup and recovery specifications** - RTO/RPO requirements for time-sensitive payroll data

## Missing Risk and Contingency Information

### System Failure Scenarios
- **API outage procedures** - what happens when SuccessFactors APIs are unavailable during critical time entry periods
- **Data inconsistency handling** - how conflicts between systems are resolved and data integrity maintained
- **Rollback procedures** - ability to revert changes during system transitions and error recovery

### Business Continuity Requirements
- **Parallel run specifications** - how long new and old systems run simultaneously, data reconciliation procedures
- **Cutover planning details** - transition timeline, user training requirements, and support procedures
- **Fallback mechanisms** - manual processes when automated systems fail, business continuity procedures

## Missing Stakeholder and Governance Information

### Decision Authority
- **Technical approval processes** - who approves integration changes, BAPI usage, and system modifications
- **Change management procedures** - how updates to award rules, business processes, and system configurations are managed
- **Vendor support arrangements** - SAP support levels, escalation procedures, and maintenance agreements

This additional context would provide the technical and business requirements necessary to design a robust, compliant, and scalable solution that meets the actual operational needs of the Queensland Department of Education.
