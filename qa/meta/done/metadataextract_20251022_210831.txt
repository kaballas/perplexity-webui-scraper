# Key Information Gaps for Enhanced Context

## Missing Business Domain Knowledge

### Queensland DoE Employment Structures
- **Complex Assignment Types**: Teachers with multiple simultaneous assignments (permanent at one school, casual at another, relief positions)
- **Award Classification System**: Teacher levels (A-L), Administrative levels (1-12), lateral movements, temporary classifications
- **Casual Relief Teacher Patterns**: Irregular hours, multiple schools, rolling 12-month accrual calculations
- **Academic Calendar Variations**: Different terms for primary/secondary/special schools, year-round schools with different break patterns

### Leave Type Specifics
- **Holiday vs. Term Leave**: Different leave types during school holidays vs. term time with special provisions
- **Professional Development Leave**: Pre-approved requirements, different calculation methods, separate from regular leave balances
- **Emergency Coverage Leave**: Priority workflows, cross-assignment impact considerations
- **Sabbatical/Study Leave**: Extended approval workflows, temporary position coverage requirements

## Real-World Processing Scenarios

### Peak Load Events
- **End-of-Year Processing**: 100K+ teachers cashing out leave simultaneously with different deadlines per school type
- **Industrial Action Periods**: Suspended accruals, modified leave provisions, compliance reporting requirements
- **School Holiday Periods**: Peak leave request periods with academic calendar constraints

### Retroactive Processing Complexity
- **Award Change Impact**: Retroactive classification changes affecting historical leave balances and already-taken leave
- **Parental Leave Returns**: Different return conditions affecting leave balance calculations and award classifications
- **Payroll Integration**: Synchronization with ECP for retroactive pay adjustments

## Integration Architecture Clarifications Needed

### Data Ownership Hierarchy
- **EC vs. ECP vs. BTP**: Clear demarcation of which system owns which data elements
- **Conflict Resolution**: Business rules for resolving data conflicts between systems
- **Synchronization Frequency**: Real-time vs. batch processing requirements for different data types

### Performance Requirements
- **Concurrent Processing**: 1000+ employees during peak periods
- **Response Time SLAs**: <2-3 seconds for leave balance queries during high-load periods
- **Bulk Operation Handling**: 50K+ calculations per hour during end-of-year processing

## Compliance and Security Requirements

### Queensland Government Specifics
- **IS18:2018 Compliance**: Audit trail requirements for government entities
- **Data Sovereignty**: Australian region-only data processing requirements
- **Industrial Relations Reporting**: Compliance reporting for union/industrial action periods
- **Disaster Recovery**: Critical periods (school holidays, pay periods) recovery requirements

## User Experience Considerations

### Role-Based Requirements
- **Multi-Assignment Managers**: Tools to view coverage impact across multiple responsibilities
- **Mobile-First Design**: Leave requests from schools during breaks, mobile accessibility needs
- **Dashboard Clarity**: Assignment-level vs. employee-level leave balance visibility
- **Workflow Prioritization**: Emergency vs. planned leave approval logic

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Integration Pattern Resolution
- **Single Primary Pattern**: Event-driven vs. point-to-point vs. hybrid approach
- **Middleware Selection**: Integration Center vs. Event Mesh vs. Kafka for different use cases
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms, retry logic
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis implementation for frequently accessed leave balances

## Critical Business Rules

### Leave Calculation Logic
- **Assignment-Level Granularity**: How leave taken for one assignment affects other assignments
- **Prorated Calculations**: Different methods for part-time, casual, and permanent employees
- **Cross-School Coverage**: Approval workflows considering coverage availability across assignments
- **Award Transition Handling**: Leave balance preservation during classification changes
