## Missing Context Information Needed for Better Understanding

### **Technical Architecture Details**
- **Current Claims Portal technical specifications** - specific limitations, data models, and integration points that need to be replaced
- **SuccessFactors OData API endpoint configurations** - exact API versions, authentication methods, and available entity types for schools/employees
- **ECP payroll system integration specifications** - data format requirements, processing rules, and error handling capabilities
- **Class Cover system technical specifications** - integration points, data structures, and timing for future integration

### **Business Process Information**
- **Current Claims Portal workflow** - step-by-step process for business development managers, approval hierarchies, and exception handling
- **Award interpretation rules** - specific award categories, calculation methods, and compliance requirements for casual employees
- **Concurrent employment handling procedures** - how multiple assignments are currently managed and paid
- **School-specific requirements** - variations in processes between different school types or locations

### **User Role and Permission Details**
- **Business development manager authorization scope** - exact permissions, school assignment rules, and access limitations
- **Employee classification types** - specific casual worker categories (non-teaching, casual teachers, etc.) and their processing differences
- **Approval workflow requirements** - who approves timesheets, escalation procedures, and authorization limits

### **Data Migration and Transition Planning**
- **Current Claims Portal data volume** - number of records, historical data requirements, and retention policies
- **Go-live strategy** - cutover approach, parallel running requirements, and rollback procedures
- **User training and change management** - adoption timeline, training materials, and support requirements

### **Performance and Scalability Requirements**
- **Expected transaction volumes** - daily timesheet entries, concurrent users, and peak processing periods
- **Response time requirements** - acceptable API call performance and system availability SLAs
- **Historical data access** - 12-month retro capability scope and data retention requirements

### **Compliance and Audit Requirements**
- **Payroll compliance standards** - regulatory requirements, audit trail needs, and reporting obligations
- **Data privacy and security** - employee data protection, access logging, and compliance certifications
- **Financial controls** - approval limits, cost center validation, and budgetary controls

This additional context would provide the technical and business understanding needed to address the integration dependencies, award interpretation placement decisions, and system design requirements more effectively.
