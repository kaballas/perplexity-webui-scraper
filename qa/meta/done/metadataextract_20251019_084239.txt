# SAP SuccessFactors Metadata Extraction Report
## BTP Phased Deployment Impact Analysis

As a senior SAP SuccessFactors Metadata Extraction Specialist, I'll provide a comprehensive metadata analysis of the BTP phased deployment considerations based on the provided context.

## Executive Summary
The metadata extraction reveals critical dependencies and integration complexities for the Queensland Department of Education's BTP phased deployment. The analysis identifies 11 high-impact scenarios that require careful metadata management and system configuration.

## Core Metadata Entities Affected

### Foundation Objects (FO) Impact
```
FOCompany: Multi-location assignment tracking
FODepartment: Cross-tranche service recognition
FOCostCenter: Funding stream allocation
FOJobCode: Concurrent employment validation
```

### MDF Objects Affected
```
Position: Multi-assignment support
JobClassification: Cross-location classification consistency
ConcurrentEmployment: Assignment relationship management
```

## Detailed Metadata Analysis by Impact Category

### High-Impact Scenarios (Requires Metadata Specialization)

#### 1. Concurrent Employment Management (E001, E002a, E002b, E003, E004, E005)
**Metadata Requirements:**
- **OData Entity:** `EmploymentInfo` with temporal data management
- **Key Fields:** `assignmentId`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `locationId`, `serviceRecognition`
- **Relationships:** 1:Many assignment-to-employee mapping
- **Audit Trail:** Version control for retroactive changes

**Picklist Dependencies:**
- Employment Status (Active, Terminated, On Leave)
- Assignment Types (Primary, Secondary, Concurrent)
- Leave Categories (Annual, Sick, LSL, LWOP)

#### 2. Financial Data Management (E007, E008, E023)
**Metadata Requirements:**
- **OData Entity:** `CompensationInfo` with tax/superannuation details
- **Key Fields:** `taxRegion`, `superannuationFund`, `thresholdAmount`
- **Business Rules:** Auto-calculation for overpayment offsets

#### 3. Transfer and Movement Processing (E011)
**Metadata Requirements:**
- **Workflow Entity:** Transfer approval processes
- **Field Mappings:** Cross-tranche transfer validation
- **Event Reasons:** Transfer triggers and calculation rules

### Low-Impact Scenarios (Standard Configuration)

#### 4. Operational Functions (E006, E010, E024)
**Metadata Requirements:**
- **Generic Objects:** Calendar and schedule definitions
- **Standard Workflows:** No cross-tranche dependencies

## Technical Metadata Specifications

### OData API Endpoints Required
```
/EmploymentInfo - Assignment tracking across tranches
/PersonalInfo - Employee master data
/JobInfo - Position and concurrent employment
/CompensationInfo - Salary and financial details
/TimeOff - Leave balance and request management
```

### Integration Mapping Matrix
| Source Entity | Target System | Field Mapping | Transformation Rules |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| EmploymentInfo | Payroll | assignmentId → payrollAssignmentId | Date-effective processing |
| TimeOff | Leave Management | leaveBalance → concurrentBalance | Multi-assignment aggregation |
| CompensationInfo | Tax/Super | taxDetails → trancheTaxDetails | Location-based validation |

### Data Quality and Governance Requirements
- **Temporal Management:** Effective start/end date preservation
- **Conflict Resolution:** Retroactive change handling
- **Version Control:** Audit trail maintenance
- **Data Lineage:** Source-to-target mapping documentation

## Critical Metadata Dependencies

### 1. Date-Effective Processing
- **Entity:** All employment-related objects
- **Requirement:** Temporal data integrity across tranches
- **Validation:** Effective dating for concurrent assignments

### 2. Payroll Synchronization
- **Entity:** CompensationInfo and TimeOff
- **Requirement:** Fortnightly cycle alignment
- **Status Flagging:** Cross-tranche assignment validation

### 3. Concurrent Employment Support
- **Entity:** EmploymentInfo and Position
- **Requirement:** Multi-assignment, multi-funding streams
- **Award Mapping:** Location-specific classification rules

## Metadata Extraction Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Export Foundation Objects:** Company, Department, Cost Center configurations
2. **Document MDF Objects:** Position and Concurrent Employment structures
3. **Extract Picklist Values:** Employment status, assignment types, leave categories
4. **Map Business Rules:** Cross-tranche validation and approval workflows

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Kafka-based real-time data transfer
2. **Approval Workflows:** Multi-level approval for cross-tranche assignments
3. **Monitoring Framework:** Real-time validation of concurrent employment data
4. **Error Handling:** Automated exception management for cross-tranche scenarios

## Risk Mitigation Metadata Strategy

### Migration Risks
- **Data Harmonization:** Legacy to MDF object mapping
- **Temporal Consistency:** Historical data integrity across tranches
- **Integration Validation:** Cross-system data consistency checks

### Governance Requirements
- **Compliance Monitoring:** IS18:2018 and IPOLA adherence
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for cross-tranche data
- **Audit Trail:** Comprehensive change logging for regulatory compliance

This metadata extraction provides the foundation for implementing the BTP phased deployment while maintaining data integrity and system functionality across all deployment tranches.
