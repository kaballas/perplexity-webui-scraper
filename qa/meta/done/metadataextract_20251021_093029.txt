### Cutover Strategy Flow
1. **Phase 1**: TSS → HR RG data migration
2. **Phase 2**: Downstream systems transition from TSS to HR RG
3. **Phase 3**: SAP operational systems go-live

### Testing Flow
- **Parallel Payroll Run Testing (PPRT)**: TSS vs SAP ECP comparison
- **End-to-end reconciliation**: payslips, deductions, leave balances, GL entries, ATO submissions
- **SAP ALM** manages PPRT linkage to Azure DevOps

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Validation Points
- **Proof of Concept Success**:
  - 1,000 employee records ingested from TSS to HR RG
  - 3,000+ tables ingested from TSS to Fabric
  - Confirmed viability of Azure DevOps + Terraform approach

### Traceability Framework
- **SAP ALM ↔ Azure DevOps** integration for unified lifecycle management
- **End-to-end test traceability** across both platforms
- **Defect tracking** linked between systems
- **Configuration management** across environments (Production, Pre-Production, Test, Development)

### Compliance Validation
- **Queensland Government IS18:2018** alignment
- **IPOLA Act 2023** compliance
- **QGEA-aligned security frameworks**
- **Microsoft Purview** for data governance and lineage

## 6. Structured Summary with Headings and Bullet Hierarchy

### Executive Summary
- **Legacy Replacement**: TSS (COBOL/Oracle) → SAP SuccessFactors + Microsoft Azure
- **Dual-Pillar Architecture**: SAP for operations, Azure for data management
- **Governance Model**: Unified DevOps across SAP and Azure platforms
