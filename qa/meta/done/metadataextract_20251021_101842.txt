## 2. Key Entities, Systems, and Components

### SAP Platform Components
| Component | Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **SAP SuccessFactors** | Core HR Foundation | Employee Central, Payroll, Recruitment, Onboarding |
| **SAP BTP** | Connectivity Layer | API communication, identity federation, extensibility |
| **SAP Integration Suite** | Data Exchange Hub | SAP ↔ External systems (Azure) connectivity |
| **SAP Data Sphere** | Semantic Modeling | SAP-specific data harmonization and modeling |
| **SAP ALM** | Lifecycle Management | Testing, change control, release documentation |
| **SAP Build Apps** | Custom Extensions | Low-code HR workflow development |
| **OpenText xECM** | Document Management | Employment record generation/storage |
| **OpenText InfoArchive** | Long-term Archival | Historical HR/payroll document retention |
| **Joule** | AI Analytics | HR insights and intelligence |
| **Signavio** | Process Analysis | Workflow optimization and analysis |
| **SAP WalkMe** | User Experience | Guided onboarding and adoption tools |

### Microsoft Azure Components
| Component | Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Microsoft Fabric HR RG** | Master Data Management | Golden record, single source of truth |
| **Medallion Architecture** | Data Organization | Bronze/Silver/Gold data layers |
| **Azure DataHub** | Data Ingestion | HR RG data intake management |
| **Dataflows/Notebooks** | Data Transformation | ETL processing and enrichment |
| **Terraform/Azure DevOps** | Infrastructure Automation | CI/CD pipeline provisioning |
| **Microsoft Purview** | Data Governance | Classification, lineage, metadata |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | Monitoring | Audit trails and alerting (replaces Splunk) |
| **Power BI Gateway** | Legacy Integration | TSS data ingestion support |

## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### Primary Data Flow Dependencies
```
SAP SuccessFactors → SAP Data Sphere → SAP Integration Suite → Azure DataHub → HR RG (Fabric)
```

### Critical Integration Chains
1. **Fieldglass → Recruiting → Onboarding → Employee Central** (Talent Acquisition Pipeline)
2. **Time Management ↔ Employee Central** (Payroll Processing Dependencies)
3. **Payroll ← Time Management** (Recalculation Dependencies)
4. **HR RG → Downstream Systems** (CIS, IAM, Alloc8, SBS, OneSchool)

### Technical Dependencies
- **High Severity**: Data migration and real-time integration dependencies between SAP and Azure
- **Blocking Dependencies**: Integration mapping documentation required before Realize–Design phase
- **Owner**: Integration Architect responsible for detailed mapping

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Data Transformation Logic
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SAP Layer** | SAP Data Sphere | SAP-specific semantic harmonization and modeling |
| **Azure Layer** | Microsoft Fabric Dataflows | Universal data processing, Medallion Architecture |
| **Purpose** | Data Sphere for SAP transformations, Fabric for universal processing |

### Integration Failure Management
**Monitoring Components:**
- SAP Integration Suite (logging/exchange monitoring)
- Azure DevOps/Terraform (ingestion job automation)
- Microsoft Sentinel (alerts and audit trails)

**Recovery Process:**
1. **Alerting**: Automated failure detection via Splunk/Microsoft Sentinel
2. **Monitoring**: Dashboard tracking of integration flow status and discrepancies
3. **Troubleshooting**: Log-based issue identification (network errors, API limits, data format problems)
4. **Re-execution**: Batch reprocessing based on failure type
5. **Reconciliation**: Automated/manual data accuracy verification, especially for critical payroll data

### Real-Time vs. Batch Processing
| Type | Use Case | Technology |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Real-Time** | Critical events (hires, terminations) | APIs or Change Data Capture (CDC) |
| **Batch** | Large, less time-sensitive data (end-of-month payroll) | Scheduled batch processing |

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Compliance Requirements
- **QGEA Standards**: Queensland Government Enterprise Architecture alignment
- **IS18:2018**: Data security and interoperability compliance
- **Data Sovereignty**: Australian Azure region data residency
- **Vendor Strategy**: Best-of-breed services to avoid lock-in

### Governance Framework
- **Microsoft Purview**: End-to-end data lineage tracking within Fabric
- **SAP ALM**: Integration suite audit trails and change management
- **Cross-Boundary Tracking**: SAP-to-Fabric integration pipeline documentation

### Performance and Scalability
- **Peak Load Handling**: SAP SuccessFactors + Azure elasticity
- **Parallel Processing**: PPRT (Parallel Payroll Run Testing) capability
- **Failover Strategy**: High availability across SAP and Azure components
- **Latency Monitoring**: SAP Integration Suite + Azure Monitor

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Severity Gaps**: Integration dependency mapping (blocking for Realize–Design)
- **Evidence Gap**: Detailed legacy-to-cloud data flows and API dependencies documentation
- **Blocking Issue**: Data migration and real-time integration dependencies must be fully mapped before proceeding

### Validation Status
- **Architecture Completeness**: High-level design established with identified gaps
- **Integration Readiness**: Critical dependencies require detailed mapping
- **Compliance Coverage**: QGEA and data sovereignty requirements addressed
- **Risk Level**: High severity integration dependencies require immediate attention

### Next Phase Requirements
- Complete integration specification and data migration planning
- Configuration documentation before Realize–Design phase transition
- Integration dependency mapping and failure recovery procedures
- Security framework implementation across hybrid SAP-Azure boundary

**Overall Assessment**: The HCMS technical architecture demonstrates a well-structured hybrid approach with clear separation of concerns between SAP and Azure components, though integration dependencies require detailed specification before implementation.
