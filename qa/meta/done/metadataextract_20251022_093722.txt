# HCMS WRICEF Requirements Analysis - Structured Notes

## 1. Document Scope and Section Hierarchy

**Primary Context**: Queensland Department of Education HCMS Programme - Explore Phase
**System Architecture**: SAP SuccessFactors Solution Design with WRICEF Framework
**Document Category**: Enterprise Solution Architecture
**Business Unit**: Queensland Department of Education
**Programme**: Human Capital Management System (HCMS) Programme

### Key Document Relationships:
- WRICEF Mapping for Key Requirements → Functional Requirements & WRICEF
- Custom WRICEF Requirements Analysis → Functional Requirements & WRICEF Classification  
- WRICEF Requirements for HCMS → Implementation Planning
- Probation Management Enhancements → Employee Central Customization

## 2. Key Entities, Systems, and Components

### Core Systems:
- **SAP SuccessFactors** (Primary HCM Platform)
- **Employee Central (EC)** - Position and Employee Management
- **MDF (Manage Data Framework)** - Custom Data Objects
- **Payroll Integration** - External Payroll Systems
- **SAP Finance Modules** - Budget and Resource Management

### WRICEF Components Identified:
- **W** - Workflows (Custom Business Processes)
- **R** - Reports (Custom Reporting Requirements) 
- **I** - Interfaces (System-to-System Integration)
- **C** - Configurations (Standard SAP Configuration)
- **E** - Enhancements (Custom Development/Extensions)

### Business Requirements Entities:
- **FTE Management** - Full-Time Equivalent Controls
- **Position Management** - Role and Position Lifecycle
- **School-Specific Requirements** - Educational Sector Customizations
- **Payroll Integration** - Automated Allowance Processing
- **Location Management** - Work Site vs Physical Location Differentiation

## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies:
```
FR-17 (FTE Cap Warnings) → MDF Objects + Custom Workflows + Validation Logic
FR-25 (School FTE Management) → External Systems Integration + MDF Extensions
FR-26 (Multi-Level FTE Allocation) → Custom Validation Rules + Reporting
FR-32 (Position-Based Allowances) → Payroll Interface + MDF Mapping
FR-37 (Dual Location Recording) → MDF Extensions + Integration
```

### Integration Dependencies:
- **Payroll Engine** ←→ **Position Allowances** (FR-32)
- **Finance Systems** ←→ **FTE Cap Management** (FR-17, FR-25, FR-26)
- **Facilities Management** ←→ **Location Data** (FR-37)
- **External School Systems** ←→ **Resource Planning** (FR-25)

### Governance Dependencies:
- **Design Assumptions**: Custom interface and enhancement requirements fully scoped and resourced
- **Integration Dependencies**: High severity, blocking items requiring WRICEF prioritization
- **Change Management**: Formal WRICEF processes for custom development governance

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Position Creation Flow (FR-17):
1. Position Creation Request → Validation Check → FTE Cap Comparison
2. MDF Object Query → Organizational Unit Limits → Real-time Validation
3. Workflow Trigger → Approval Process → Position Finalization

### FTE Management Flow (FR-25, FR-26):
1. Organizational Hierarchy → Multi-level FTE Calculation → Allocation Rules
2. MDF Extensions → Custom Attributes → Validation Workflows
3. Finance Integration → Budget Synchronization → Reporting

### Payroll Integration Flow (FR-32):
1. Position Assignment → Allowance Mapping → MDF Object Linkage
2. Interface Trigger → Payroll Engine Communication → Calculation Inclusion
3. Data Synchronization → Automated Processing → Validation

### Location Recording Flow (FR-37):
1. Employee Data Entry → Dual Location Capture → MDF Storage
2. Validation Rules → Data Quality Check → System Integration
3. Reporting → Location Analytics → Compliance Tracking

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Requirement Validation:
- **FR-17**: Real-time FTE cap validation requires custom enhancement (E) and MDF objects
- **FR-25**: School-specific FTE management requires interface (I) and enhancement (E)
- **FR-26**: Multi-level FTE allocation requires enhancement (E) and report (R)
- **FR-32**: Position-based allowances require interface (I) and enhancement (E)
- **FR-37**: Dual location recording requires enhancement (E) and interface (I)

### Technical Validation:
- Standard SuccessFactors EC does not provide real-time organizational FTE cap validation
- Multi-level organizational constraints require custom validation logic beyond standard capabilities
- Position-to-payroll allowance synchronization requires custom interface development
- School-specific hierarchies and attributes need MDF extensions and custom workflows

### Traceability Matrix:
| FR ID | Requirement Type | WRICEF Classification | Integration Impact | Priority |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| FR-17 | FTE Cap Validation | E (Enhancement) | High | High |
| FR-25 | School FTE Management | I (Interface), E (Enhancement) | High | High |
| FR-26 | Multi-level FTE | E (Enhancement), R (Report) | Medium | High |
| FR-32 | Payroll Allowances | I (Interface), E (Enhancement) | High | Critical |
| FR-37 | Location Recording | E (Enhancement), I (Interface) | Medium | Medium |

### Quality Assurance:
- All identified requirements exceed standard SuccessFactors capabilities
- WRICEF classifications align with SAP implementation best practices
- Integration dependencies validated against HCMS technical architecture
- Change management processes documented for formal WRICEF governance

**Confidence Score**: 1.0 for technical accuracy, 0.9 for implementation feasibility based on documented HCMS programme context.
