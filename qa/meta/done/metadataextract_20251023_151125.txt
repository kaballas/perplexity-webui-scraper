# Missing Context Information for CTE Specification Analysis

## **Technical Architecture Gaps**

### BAPI Implementation Details
- **Current BAPI selection rationale** and comparison with alternative time management BAPIs
- **Award interpretation business rules** specific to Queensland DoE that require ECP-level processing
- **Multi-assignment data model** implementation in SuccessFactors for concurrent casual employment
- **Cost center allocation** mechanisms for line-item level distribution across multiple assignments

### Integration Architecture
- **Class Cover system** functional scope and current integration patterns with existing systems
- **Real-time synchronization** requirements between Employee Central and CTE for assignment changes
- **Cross-system validation** mechanisms to prevent duplicate allowances across substantive/casual employment
- **Retroactive processing** performance implications and batch processing capabilities

## **Business Process Requirements**

### Queensland DoE Specific Rules
- **Concurrent employment validation** rules preventing duplicate daily allowances across multiple schools
- **Substantive vs. casual employment** definitions and validation criteria in DoE context
- **HED-019 conversion rules** mapping various allowances to casual payment types
- **12-month retroactive entry** business justification and approval escalation requirements

### Operational Workflows
- **Manager approval escalation** procedures for unavailable approvers during peak periods
- **Employee lifecycle events** handling during active timesheet periods (termination, assignment changes)
- **Cross-assignment conflict detection** for teachers working multiple schools simultaneously
- **Emergency payment** procedures and override mechanisms

## **Compliance and Governance**

### Audit Requirements
- **Queensland government audit standards** for casual payment processing and record retention
- **Financial management compliance** specific to education sector payroll processing
- **Data retention policies** and OpenText InfoArchive integration requirements
- **Change tracking** and audit trail specifications for regulatory compliance

### Risk Management
- **Peak load handling** requirements during pay period end processing
- **Error recovery procedures** for partial integration failures
- **Data integrity mechanisms** for maintaining historical timesheet accuracy
- **System reliability** SLAs and performance requirements

## **Integration Boundaries**

### System Interface Specifications
- **Class Cover integration boundary** definition and data exchange protocols
- **Claims Portal replacement** functionality scope and migration requirements
- **OpenText InfoArchive** integration patterns for long-term retention
- **Employee Central synchronization** frequency and conflict resolution procedures

## **Performance Requirements**

### Scalability Specifications
- **Expected concurrent users** during peak processing periods
- **Response time SLAs** for different processing types (real-time vs. batch)
- **Database performance** requirements for assignment and employee data queries
- **System capacity planning** for 1000+ casual teacher simultaneous access

## **Exception Handling**

### Edge Case Scenarios
- **Mid-period employment changes** and their impact on pending timesheets
- **Assignment overlap detection** and resolution procedures
- **Delegated authority management** in approval workflows
- **Payment status tracking** during partial system failures

This information would provide the technical and business context necessary to validate the CTE specification against actual Queensland DoE operational requirements and technical constraints.
