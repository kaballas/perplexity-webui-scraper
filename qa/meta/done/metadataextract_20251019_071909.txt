## 10. Quality Assurance Considerations

### 10.1 Data Validation Rules
- **Service calculation accuracy**: Verify all exclusion rules
- **Cross-counting validation**: Ensure role-specific counting rules
- **Conversion formula verification**: Test all conversion scenarios
- **Leave exclusion compliance**: Validate against DoE directive

### 10.2 Testing Scenarios
- **Concurrent employment**: Dual role increment progression
- **Higher duties transitions**: Service recognition during role changes
- **Leave scenarios**: All LWOP types and exclusion periods
- **Manual adjustments**: Prior service recognition and date modifications
- **Retrospective changes**: Impact on already applied increments

## 11. Implementation Dependencies

### 11.1 Critical Dependencies
- **EC Configuration**: Job Information and Employment Information setup
- **ECP Configuration**: Infotype 0509 and 2001 implementation
- **Integration Setup**: EC to ECP data flow
