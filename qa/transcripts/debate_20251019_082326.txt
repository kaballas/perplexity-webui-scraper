Topic: E010 – SCHOOL HOLIDAY CALENDAR / PUPIL FREE DAYS
The School Holiday Calendar is important to hold directly in ECP for the following reasons:
1. Payment Calculations: These calculations are often based on the number of school days and
the academic calendar.
2. Service Periods for Teachers: The school year affects how temporary positions can convert to
permanent roles based on service duration.
3. Planning for Next School Year: Processes that require foresight into the structure and schedule
of the upcoming school year, typically known up to two years in advance.
4. Vacation Payment Calculations: These calculations may depend on the school year structure
and the number of school days.
5. Employee Notifications and Adjustments: Changes in employment status and notifications
related to the school year can impact staffing and payroll.
Current State
In-built School Calendar in TSS apart from Detention Centres which causes manual workarounds
Future State - Out of The Box
As the School Calendar is specific to Queensland DoE there is no native configuration within
SuccessFactors to hold this information.
There are however a number of ways to hold this information utilising standard configuration:
1) Additional Payroll Calendar
2) New ‘Day’ Class to determine a school day from a pupil free day
Both options above would require an element of derivation to determine key data elements to support
the processes that rely on school calendar, as such there is a requirement for an extension.
Enhancement Considerations
To support the calculations of various process, the best way to achieve the requirement is store all
relevant information within a custom table in ECP. It’s not enough just to identify a school day for a given
school year but details on Term start and end dates, total school days in the year and length of vacation.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central Payroll
A custom table will be created in SAP customer name range and should contain the following data
elements:
Data Element Description Example
Year Calendar Year for Terms 2026
Page | 226
School Type 6 Week or 7 Week School or Detention Centre 6 Week
School Year Start Date 1st Day of the School Year 22.01.2026
School Year End Date Last Day of the School Year 11.12.2026
Term 1 Start Date 1st Day of Term 1 22.01.2026
Term 1 End Date Last Day of Term 1 02.04.2026
Term 1 Days Number of School Days in Term 54
Term 2 Start Date 1st Day of Term 2 16.04.2026
Term 2 End Date Last Day of Term 2 26.06.2026
Term 2 Days Number of School Days in Term 50
Term 3 Start Date 1st Day of Term 3 13.07.2026
Term 3 End Date Last Day of Term 3 18.09.2026
Term 3 Days Number of School Days in Term 51
Term 4 Start Date 1st Day of Term 4 06.10.2026
Term 4 End Date Last Day of Term 4 11.12.2026
Term 4 Days Number of School Days in Term 53
Summer Vacation Start Date 1st Day of Summer Vacation 12.12.2026
Summer Vacation End Date Last Day of Summer Vacation 20.01.2027
Summer Vacation Payment Date Date that Vacation Payment should be processed 12.12.2026
Summer Vacation Entitlement Number of Days - 6 or 7 Week School 28
Total School Days Number of School Days for the Year 203
Staff Professional Development Days don’t need to be loaded specifically in the School Holiday Calendar
table; however, these will be identifiable through a different day class.
School Day Information
Data Element Description Example
Date Day of School Year 22.01.2026
6 Week 6 Week School Day 0 or 1
7 Week 7 Week School Day 0 or 1
The upload of these dates will be done as a periodical payroll process once the future school holiday
calendar dates are confirmed by the Department.
