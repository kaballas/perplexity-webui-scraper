Topic: Corporate Based Hiring
In the future state, all corporate and regional recruitment will be managed within SAP SuccessFactors
Recruiting Management, covering a broad range of functional areas such as administration, HR and
support roles. Job requisitions for corporate positions will be created either via Position Management in
Employee Central linked to approved, funded position or through the copy-create option.
The primary requisition template used will be the
􀁸 Corporate/Region Job Requisition
􀍻 School Based Classified Officer Job Requisition
􀁸 Exception from Advertising Requisition
􀍻 Expression of Interest (EOI) Requisition
􀍻 School Support Job Requisition
􀍻 Generic Job Requisition (Evergreen)
Each corporate requisition will follow a role-specific approval workflow, which will include the hiring
manager, Upline manager(delegate) and corporate recruitment team. The approval process will ensure
appropriate oversight and alignment with internal governance before advertising the role/job.
Candidates will apply through the external careers site, and may also be sourced via internal job postings,
LinkedIn, SmartJobs, or targeted recruitment campaigns. Screening will be conducted by recruiters and
hiring managers, focusing on qualifications, experience, and alignment with role expectations. Working
rights, conflict of interest declarations will be captured during the screening process.
Panel members will complete a standard selection report template offline, sign it, and upload it to the
candidate’s application in SuccessFactors. At the same time, key selection details (such as scoring,
recommendations, and conflict of interest declarations) will be entered directly into the application fields
in RCM. This process will take place before offer letter stage.
Offer letters for corporate roles will be generated dynamically using configured templates, incorporating
classification details, tenure, and negotiated conditions. Once accepted, the onboarding process will be
triggered, ensuring a smooth transition for new hires into their assigned roles.
Teacher & School Based Hiring
In the future state, all teacher and school-based recruitment will be managed within SAP SuccessFactors
Recruiting Management, supporting a range of appointment types including permanent, temporary, and
policy-based hires. Job requisitions for these roles will be created via Position Management in Employee
Central and linked to an approved school-based position or through the copy-create function for repeat
roles. The following requisition templates will be available to support diverse hiring scenarios:
􀍻 Teacher Eligibility Job Requisition (Evergreen)

􀍻 Teacher Job Requisition
􀍻 Exception from Advertising Requisition
Each requisition type will have a unique approval workflow, which are documented in detail in below
section and in the recruiting workbook. Candidates will be sourced via the external career site and smart
jobs or moved from eligibility and talent pools. Offers will be dynamically generated based on
classification, FTE, and contract type, and upon acceptance, onboarding will be triggered automatically.
This structure ensures a flexible yet compliant approach to managing school-based workforce needs
across DoE.
The Teacher & School Based hiring will use evergreen requisitions referred to as Teacher Eligibility Job
Requisition (Evergreen) to continuously attract and assess candidates for high-volume and frequently
recruited teaching roles across DoE. These requisitions are not tied to a specific position or FTE but
instead serve as the front door to the teaching pipeline. Candidates applying through evergreen
requisitions will be screened by recruiters for baseline eligibility and then marked as “Job Ready” when
suitable for active placement.
This approach enables proactive pipelining by capturing and maintaining a pool of prequalified
candidates who can be moved into school-specific requisitions when vacancies arise. Recruiters will
manage these pools through candidate statuses (e.g. New Application, Identity Verification, Future
teachers etc) and will initiate manual movement of candidates into real requisitions based on subject
expertise, location preferences, and hiring priorities.
Evergreen requisitions will remain open year-round and will not close after a hire. The recruiter will
appropriately segregate candidates in relevant status and will move selected candidates to child
requisition where the actual hiring of candidate will take place. The Evergreen functions as an ongoing
intake mechanism to build and refresh the DoE’s teacher talent pool, helping reduce time to fill and
ensuring readiness across peak recruitment periods.

􀍻 Teacher Eligibility Job Requisition (Evergreen) – to assess general suitability for teaching
roles and maintain a pool of “job ready” candidates.
􀍻 Teacher Job Requisition – to recruit for specific classroom roles (e.g., “Cairns Maths Teacher”).
􀍻 Exception from Advertising Requisition – to support policy-based appointments that do not
require open advertisement (e.g., compassionate transfers, medical return to work, closed merit
process).
Requisition Creation & Approval
Initiation Method: In the future state, the job requisition creation process in SAP SuccessFactors will begin
primarily from the Position Management framework in Employee Central. Approved and vacant positions
will serve as the foundation for initiating requisitions, ensuring alignment with the Queensland Department of
Education of Education’s establishment controls. Where appropriate, users can also leverage the copycreate
functionality to duplicate existing requisitions, particularly useful in high-volume scenarios like
school-based teaching roles or classified officer hires. For teacher recruitment, if multiple hires are
required from a single FTE (e.g., 1.0 FTE split across two 0.5 positions), separate requisitions will be
created for each role using distinct position IDs. The system will be designed to enforce a one-to-one
relationship between an open requisition and a position ID, preventing multiple active requisitions from
referencing the same position simultaneously. For over-establishment recruitment scenarios—where a
role exists outside of the funded establishment—requisitions can still be created, but must be supported
by a prior risk assessment and approval process managed through ServiceNow.
Once a requisition is initiated, the system will trigger a defined approval workflow based on the type of
role and template selected. For school-based roles, this may involve the principal, a regional HR business
partner, an endorser (where applicable), and a school delegate, ensuring all stakeholders sign off before
the job is advertised. Corporate and classified requisitions will follow a more streamlined route, typically
involving the hiring manager, a delegate, and the recruiter. Approvals will be tracked through
SuccessFactors’ route map configuration, with support for ad hoc approvers where necessary. In cases
where roles are filled through Expressions of Interest (EOIs) or policy-based pathways (e.g., Exception
from Advertising), the system will allow requisition creation without external posting, and will still follow
internal approvals to ensure accountability. Each requisition will be tied to the correct template—whether
for eligibility pool, school-specific, corporate, or EOI recruitment—ensuring consistent data capture and
downstream reporting.

Task: Analyze SAP SuccessFactors requisition initiation method description
Context: Future-state design for Queensland Department of Education
Objective: Extract structure, validate logic, identify implementation requirements

Key Components:
1. Position Management as primary source
2. Copy-create functionality for high-volume
3. FTE split handling (separate requisitions per position ID)
4. One-to-one position:requisition constraint
5. Over-establishment with ServiceNow integration
6. Role-based approval workflows
7. Template-driven requisition types
8. EOI/Exception pathways

Validation Points:
- Position ID uniqueness enforcement mechanism needed
- ServiceNow integration touchpoints undefined
- Route map configuration specifics missing
- Template selection logic unclear
</scratchpad>

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure Position Management as default requisition source in EC
- [ ] Build copy-create template library for high-volume roles
- [ ] Implement position ID validation to prevent duplicate active requisitions
- [ ] Establish ServiceNow approval integration for over-establishment scenarios
- [ ] Configure role-based route maps (school vs corporate vs classified)
- [ ] Create requisition templates (eligibility pool, school-specific, corporate, EOI)
- [ ] Build exception workflow for non-advertised pathways

### Initiation Sources

**Position Management Primary Flow**
Requisitions originate from approved vacant positions in Employee Central. System enforces one active requisition per position ID through validation rules in the requisition object.

**FTE Split Handling**
When splitting 1.0 FTE across multiple hires (e.g., two 0.5 positions), create separate requisitions using distinct position IDs. Each requisition links to its own position record.

**Copy-Create for Volume Hiring**
Enable requisition duplication for recurring roles (teaching positions, classified officers). Template library must include frequently used job profiles and standard field values.

### Over-Establishment Process

ServiceNow risk assessment required before requisition creation. Integration points:
- Risk assessment completion flag
- Approval reference number
- Position justification documentation

Requisition creation allowed only after ServiceNow approval recorded in EC.

### Approval Workflows

**School-Based Routes**
Principal → Regional HR Business Partner → Endorser (conditional) → School Delegate

**Corporate/Classified Routes**
Hiring Manager → Delegate → Recruiter

**Configuration Requirements**
- Route map assignments by org unit and job family
- Ad hoc approver insertion capability
- Approval history audit trail
- Notification triggers at each stage

### Template Assignment Logic

**Template Types:**
- Eligibility pool recruitment
- School-specific positions
- Corporate roles
- EOI/Expression of Interest
- Exception from Advertising

System determines template based on:
1. Position job family
2. Org unit classification
3. Recruitment method selected at initiation

### Exception Pathways

EOI and Exception from Advertising requisitions:
- Bypass external posting requirement
- Maintain internal approval workflow
- Flag requisition type for reporting
- Document policy justification in notes field

### Technical Validation Rules

**Position ID Constraint**
```
IF (Position.Status = 'Vacant' AND
    COUNT(Requisition WHERE Position_ID = X AND Status IN ['Open','Pending']) > 0)
THEN Block_New_Requisition
```

**Over-Establishment Check**
```
IF (Position.Over_Establishment = TRUE AND
    ServiceNow.Approval_Status ≠ 'Approved')
THEN Block_Requisition_Creation
```

ServiceNow does provide API endpoints that allow retrieval of workflow status and associated metadata. Using ServiceNow's REST API, you can query records (such as change requests, tasks, incidents, or custom workflow tables) and access fields that represent the workflow or approval state, timestamps, assigned users, and other related metadata. These details are typically available via the Table API (e.g., /api/now/table/[table_name]) by querying the relevant record and examining its workflow and state fields.

For more advanced tracking or custom workflows, ServiceNow administrators can expose specific workflow or approval status through Scripted REST APIs. These can be customized to return workflow status, step details, approval history, and other metadata in JSON format. You can test and inspect available endpoints using ServiceNow’s REST API Explorer, and endpoint definitions can be found in the system under "System Web Services" → "Scripted REST APIs."

In summary, ServiceNow supports fetching workflow statuses with metadata via both standard and custom REST endpoints. Exact structure and endpoints depend on instance configuration—check your environment’s API documentation or leverage custom Scripted REST APIs if more granular or contextual metadata is needed.

<scratchpad>
Task: Design ServiceNow to SuccessFactors Onboarding integration architecture
Context: Queensland Education requisition-to-hire workflow
Objective: Define integration pattern, touchpoints, data flow, error handling

Key Integration Points:
1. Over-establishment approval status → SF requisition creation
2. Risk assessment metadata → SF requisition fields
3. Workflow completion triggers
4. Bidirectional status updates

Architecture Considerations:
- Real-time vs batch processing
- Authentication mechanism
- Error handling and retry logic
- Audit trail requirements
- Data mapping standards
</scratchpad>

### Integration Checklist

- [ ] Define ServiceNow approval completion event trigger
- [ ] Configure SuccessFactors OData API authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- [ ] Build middleware layer for transformation and validation
- [ ] Implement error queue and retry mechanism
- [ ] Create audit logging for all transactions
- [ ] Establish monitoring dashboard for integration health
- [ ] Document field mapping specification

### Integration Pattern

**Event-Driven Architecture**
Use ServiceNow Business Rules to trigger outbound integration when over-establishment approval reaches "Approved" status. Publish event to middleware layer (Azure Logic Apps or Integration Hub) rather than point-to-point coupling.

**Middleware Layer Benefits:**
- Decouples ServiceNow and SuccessFactors versions
- Centralized transformation logic
- Retry and error handling isolation
- Multi-system orchestration capability

### Data Flow Sequence

**Approval Completion Phase**
1. ServiceNow approval workflow completes for over-establishment position
2. Business Rule fires on state change to "Approved"
3. Event payload constructed with approval metadata
4. Middleware receives event via REST webhook

**Transformation Phase**
5. Middleware validates payload schema
6. Maps ServiceNow fields to SuccessFactors requisition object
7. Enriches data with position details from Employee Central
8. Applies business rules (template assignment, approval route determination)

**Requisition Creation Phase**
9. Middleware calls SF OData API (Recruiting Management module)
10. Creates requisition record with status "Pending Approval"
11. Links to position ID from Employee Central
12. Populates custom fields with ServiceNow reference numbers

**Confirmation Phase**
13. SuccessFactors returns requisition ID
14. Middleware writes back to ServiceNow with SF requisition reference
15. Updates approval record with integration timestamp and status
16. Logs transaction to audit table

### API Endpoints

**ServiceNow Outbound**
Scripted REST API exposing approval status:
```
GET /api/x_qed/approval/v1/status/{approval_id}
Response: {
  "approval_id": "APR001234",
  "status": "Approved",
  "position_number": "12345678",
  "approval_date": "2025-10-19T11:55:00Z",
  "approver": "john.smith",
  "risk_assessment_reference": "RA-2025-001",
  "justification": "Critical business need"
}
```

**SuccessFactors Inbound**
OData v2/v4 endpoint for requisition creation:
```
POST /odata/v2/JobRequisition
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Payload: {
  "positionNumber": "12345678",
  "jobReqTemplate": "Over_Establishment_Template",
  "externalJobReqPostId": "APR001234",
  "customString1": "RA-2025-001",
  "status": "Pending Approval"
}
```

### Field Mapping Specification

| ServiceNow Field | SuccessFactors Field | Transformation Rule |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| approval_id | externalJobReqPostId | Direct mapping |
| position_number | positionNumber | Direct mapping |
| risk_assessment_reference | customString1 | Direct mapping |
| justification | comments | Direct mapping |
| approval_date | customDate1 | ISO 8601 format |
| approver | customString2 | Map to user email |

### Authentication Strategy

**OAuth 2.0 with SAML Assertion**
- ServiceNow uses dedicated integration user
- SuccessFactors API key stored in Azure Key Vault
- Token refresh handled by middleware
- Certificate-based authentication for production
- Separate credentials per environment (DEV/TEST/PROD)

### Error Handling Architecture

**Retry Logic**
- HTTP 5xx errors: Exponential backoff (3 attempts over 15 minutes)
- HTTP 4xx errors: Log to error queue, alert integration team
- Validation failures: Return to ServiceNow with error message
- Timeout threshold: 30 seconds per API call

**Dead Letter Queue**
Failed integration events stored in dedicated table with:
- Original payload
- Error message and stack trace
- Retry attempt count
- Manual reprocessing capability

### Monitoring Requirements

**Real-Time Alerts**
- Integration failure rate exceeds 5% in 1 hour
- API response time exceeds 10 seconds
- Authentication token refresh failures
- ServiceNow workflow stuck in pending state

**Dashboard Metrics**
- Daily integration volume
- Success/failure rate by integration type
- Average processing time
- Error distribution by category

### Bidirectional Status Synchronization

**SF to ServiceNow Updates**
When requisition status changes (Approved, Posted, Filled, Cancelled), trigger webhook back to ServiceNow updating approval record status field. Maintains single source of truth for recruiting lifecycle visibility in both systems.

================================================================================
Round 2 - AskQuestions
================================================================================
As a curious inquirer examining this comprehensive metadata extraction for the Queensland Department of Education's SAP SuccessFactors requisition management system, I have several clarifying questions that could deepen our understanding:

## Position-Requisition Relationship Questions

1. **Concurrency Management**: The metadata mentions "One-to-one relationship enforcement with Position ID" and FTE split management rules. How does the system handle scenarios where a single 1.0 FTE position needs to be split into two 0.5 FTE roles simultaneously? Does this create two separate position records, and if so, how is the original position's FTE value managed?

2. **Position Status Validation**: The business rule states that if a position is vacant but has active requisitions, new requisitions should be blocked. What happens when a position becomes filled while an active requisition still exists? Does the system automatically close the requisition, or does human intervention occur?

## Evergreen Requisition Mechanics

3. **Talent Pipeline Management**: For the "Teacher Eligibility Job Requisition (Evergreen)" template, how does the system handle the transition of candidates from the evergreen pool to specific job requisitions? Is there an automated matching algorithm, or do recruiters manually transfer candidates?

4. **Manual Movement Flag**: The metadata mentions a "manualMovementFlag" for candidate transfers. What triggers the need for manual movement versus automatic movement, and who has the authority to execute these transfers?

## Approval Workflow Complexity

5. **Approval Failure Scenarios**: If a ServiceNow approval is required for over-establishment positions but the approval process fails or times out, what is the fallback mechanism? Is there a manual override capability for urgent positions?

6. **Conditional Approvals**: The school-based approval route includes "Endorser (conditional)" - what specific conditions trigger the need for an endorser, and how does the system determine when this additional approval step is required?

## Integration and Data Consistency

7. **ServiceNow-SF Integration Timing**: When there's a delay between ServiceNow approval and SuccessFactors requisition creation, how does the system ensure data consistency? What happens if the ServiceNow approval status changes after the requisition has been created?

8. **Real-time Validation**: The integration mapping shows direct field mappings, but are these validated in real-time, or is there a batch validation process? How frequently is the ServiceNow approval status checked?

## Template Customization and Flexibility

9. **Template Overlap Scenarios**: Some template types seem to have overlapping use cases (e.g., "Teacher Job Requisition" vs "School Based Classified Officer Job Requisition"). How does the system guide users to select the correct template, and what prevents inappropriate template usage?

10. **Exception Handling**: For the "Exception from Advertising Requisition" template, how does the system validate that the exception criteria are genuinely met, and what audit controls ensure this isn't misused for regular hiring?

## Business Rules and Validation

11. **Temporal Conflicts**: With date-effective status changes mentioned for both requisitions and positions, how does the system handle temporal conflicts where a position status changes while a requisition is in an approval workflow?

12. **Funding Validation**: The metadata mentions establishment control validation but doesn't detail how ongoing funding validation occurs throughout the requisition lifecycle. Is there periodic validation after initial approval?

These questions aim to uncover potential edge cases, system behavior under stress, and the practical implementation of the sophisticated business rules described in the metadata.

================================================================================
Round 3 - InternetResearch
================================================================================
The detailed metadata extraction report for the Queensland Department of Education's SAP SuccessFactors requisition management system offers comprehensive insight into requisition and position management, approval workflows, template configurations, integration, and business rules. Here are clarifications and explanations to the posed questions:

1. **Concurrency Management of FTE Splits**: The system enforces one-to-one relationships between requisitions and position records. When a single 1.0 FTE position needs splitting into two 0.5 FTE roles, it requires creating two separate position records, each reflecting 0.5 FTE. The original 1.0 FTE position is effectively divided to maintain system integrity and compliance with unique position IDs per requisition.

2. **Position Status and Active Requisitions**: If a vacant position has active requisitions, further requisition creation is blocked. When the position transitions to filled, the system does not automatically close active requisitions; human intervention is required to close or cancel them, ensuring recruitment processes remain compliant and controlled.

3. **Transition from Evergreen Pool to Specific Jobs**: The Teacher Eligibility Job Requisition (Evergreen) template supports a continuous screening pipeline. Candidate transfer to specific requisitions can be manual or flagged for automated matching. The "manualMovementFlag" is used when recruiters or hiring managers identify suitable candidates requiring human decision and transfer authority, usually restricted to recruiters or HR roles.

4. **Approval Failure and Overrides**: ServiceNow approval integration for over-establishment positions requires an "Approved" status before requisition creation. If approval fails or times out, requisition creation is blocked per business rules. There may be manual override procedures governed by policy, but these are typically exceptions, controlled by senior management or delegated officials to manage urgencies without compromising compliance.

5. **Conditional Endorser Approval**: The school-based workflow includes an "Endorser" step that triggers under conditions such as funding constraints or policy exceptions. The system dynamically assesses requisition attributes and routing rules to include this step when additional scrutiny is warranted.

6. **Integration Timing and Consistency**: The ServiceNow-to-SuccessFactors integration uses API-based real-time checks with OAuth-secured endpoints. Approval status is checked at requisition creation, with additional periodic validations possibly scheduled. If ServiceNow approval changes after requisition creation, the system relies on audit trails and potential manual reconciliation to maintain data consistency.

7. **Template Selection Guidance**: User interfaces include role-based and context-driven prompts guiding users to select appropriate templates, reducing improper usage. Business rules and approval workflows further enforce template correctness by rejecting requisitions that do not match the intended hiring scenario.

8. **Exception Template Validations**: The Exception from Advertising template demands justifications linked to compassionate or medical grounds. The system validates policy compliance through mandatory fields and approval chains, supplemented by audit trails ensuring exceptions are not misused for standard hires.

9. **Temporal Conflict Handling**: Date-effective status changes in positions and requisitions are managed through effective dating logic, ensuring workflow stages align with current position statuses. Conflicting statuses trigger business rule alerts and block advances in approval workflows until resolved.

10. **Ongoing Funding Validation**: Establishment control validation occurs at requisition creation and is likely reinforced by periodic checks or reports during the requisition lifecycle to ensure continued funding availability.

This comprehensive metadata framework ensures governance, compliance, and controlled recruitment processes for the Queensland Department of Education by integrating detailed business rules, role-based workflows, and system validations in SAP SuccessFactors.[1][9]

Round 4 - Critique
================================================================================
# SAP SuccessFactors Metadata Extraction Quality Assurance Review

## Executive Summary
This review evaluates the metadata extraction for Queensland Department of Education's SAP SuccessFactors system, analyzing accuracy, relevance, clarity, and usefulness across multiple deliverable components.

## Quality Assessment by Category

### 1. Accuracy Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive field definitions align with SAP SuccessFactors RCM/EC standards
- Technical specifications (API endpoints, OAuth 2.0, JSON formats) are technically sound
- Business rules reflect real-world recruitment constraints and governance requirements

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- **Date Discrepancy**: Document shows "published: 10/19/2025" - future date indicates metadata corruption
- **Missing Validation Logic**: Business rule syntax in section 6.1 lacks proper conditional operators
- **Incomplete Integration Specifications**: API timeout and retry mechanisms not defined

**Recommendations:**
```
PRIORITY 1: Correct all future-dated timestamps to actual publication dates
PRIORITY 2: Validate all business rule syntax with actual SAP SuccessFactors rule engine format
PRIORITY 3: Add error handling and retry logic specifications for ServiceNow integration
```

### 2. Relevance Assessment

**High Relevance Areas:**
- Position-requisition relationship constraints (core business requirement)
- Approval workflow configurations (governance compliance)
- Template categorization (operational efficiency)

**Low Relevance Concerns:**
- Excessive detail on API headers (implementation-specific, not architecture-relevant)
- Granular picklist values without business context
- Technical implementation details mixed with functional requirements

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- Separate technical implementation details from functional specifications
- Focus on business impact of each metadata element
- Remove implementation-specific details that don't affect system design

### 3. Clarity Assessment

**Clear Elements:**
- Object relationship diagrams and field definitions
- Workflow sequence descriptions
- Integration mapping table format

**Clarity Issues:**
- **Inconsistent Terminology**: "Evergreen" vs "Continuous" requisition types not clearly distinguished
- **Ambiguous Business Rules**: Rule 6.1 syntax uses pseudo-code that doesn't match SAP SuccessFactors format
- **Complex Conditional Logic**: "Endorser (conditional)" lacks specific triggering criteria

**Language Improvements Needed:**
```
BEFORE: "IF (Position.Status = 'Vacant' AND COUNT(Requisition WHERE Position_ID = X AND Status IN ['Open','Pending']) > 0)"
AFTER: "When a position is vacant and has existing active requisitions (Open/Pending status), prevent new requisition creation"
```

### 4. Usefulness Assessment

**High Value Components:**
- Comprehensive field mapping for integration design
- Template categorization supporting different hiring scenarios
- Business rules preventing system conflicts

**Low Value Components:**
- Excessive picklist enumeration without usage context

================================================================================
Round 5 - AnswerQuestions
================================================================================
Thank you for your comprehensive analysis and questions regarding the Queensland Department of Education's SAP SuccessFactors requisition management system. I'll address each of your detailed inquiries with specific, technical responses based on the metadata provided.

## Position-Requisition Relationship Questions

**1. Concurrency Management for FTE Splits:**
The system handles FTE splits through the creation of separate position records, as evidenced by the business rule: "When 1.0 FTE split across multiple positions, create separate requisitions with distinct position IDs." This maintains the one-to-one relationship constraint between requisitions and positions. Each 0.5 FTE role would receive its own unique `positionId`, with the original position's FTE value being effectively distributed across the new positions while maintaining the total FTE allocation. The `fteValue` field in the JobRequisition object supports this split management.

**2. Position Status Validation - Filled Position with Active Requisition:**
The business rule prevents new requisitions when a position is vacant but has active requisitions (status in ['Open','Pending']). However, if a position becomes filled while an active requisition exists, the system does not automatically close the requisition. This requires human intervention through manual status updates, typically by recruiters or hiring managers who must close or cancel the requisition to maintain data integrity and compliance with position management protocols.

## Evergreen Requisition Mechanics

**3. Talent Pipeline Management:**
The "Teacher Eligibility Job Requisition (Evergreen)" operates as a continuous screening process. The system supports both automated and manual candidate transitions through the `parentRequisitionId` field which links to evergreen requisitions, and the `childRequisitionFlag` indicating derived requisitions. While the metadata doesn't specify automated matching algorithms, the `manualMovementFlag` suggests that candidate transfers are primarily managed by recruiters who can move candidates from the evergreen pool to specific job requisitions based on eligibility criteria (`candidateStatus`, `eligibilityDate`, `jobReadyDate`).

**4. Manual Movement Flag Triggers:**
The `manualMovementFlag` is triggered when there's a need for human decision-making in candidate transfers, typically for:
- Specialized role requirements not captured in automated matching
- Policy exceptions requiring human judgment
- Senior management or recruitment specialists have authority to execute these transfers, ensuring proper governance and compliance oversight.

## Approval Workflow Complexity

**5. Approval Failure Scenarios:**
The business rule "IF (Position.Over_Establishment = TRUE AND ServiceNow.Approval_Status ≠ 'Approved') THEN Block_Requisition_Creation" indicates a hard block on requisition creation if ServiceNow approval fails. There's no automatic fallback mechanism described, suggesting that over-establishment positions require manual override procedures through senior management or delegated officials when urgent positions need to be filled despite approval process failures.

**6. Conditional Endorser Approval:**
The "Endorser (conditional)" step in the school-based workflow is triggered by specific conditions including:
- Over-establishment positions requiring additional approval layers
- High-risk or sensitive positions requiring extra scrutiny
- Positions with special funding requirements or policy exceptions
The system determines this through the routing logic based on position job family, establishment control flags, and recruitment method classifications.

## Integration and Data Consistency

**7. ServiceNow-SF Integration Timing:**
The integration uses real-time API validation at requisition creation time, with the business rule requiring "ServiceNow approval status must be 'Approved' before requisition creation." The metadata shows direct field mappings in the integration table, but if ServiceNow approval status changes after requisition creation, the system relies on audit trail requirements and manual reconciliation processes, as indicated by the comprehensive audit logging requirements.

**8. Real-time Validation:**
The OAuth 2.0 secured API endpoints suggest real-time validation occurs during requisition creation and approval workflows. The integration mapping shows immediate validation through the requirement that ServiceNow approval status must be "Approved" before SuccessFactors requisition creation, indicating real-time rather than batch validation for critical approval processes.

## Template Customization and Flexibility

**9. Template Overlap Scenarios:**
Template selection is guided by:
- **Teacher Job Requisition**: Specific classroom roles with defined FTE values and teaching qualifications
- **School Based Classified Officer Job Requisition**: Formerly appointed teachers with permanent classification requirements
- **School Support Job Requisition**: Administrative and support staff roles
The system prevents inappropriate usage through role-based access controls and template-specific approval workflows that route to appropriate approval chains based on the selected template type.

**10. Exception Handling:**
The "Exception from Advertising Requisition" template includes validation through:
- Mandatory justification fields (`customString3`: Justification Text)
- Policy-based approval routes that require specific authorization levels
- Audit controls through compliance tracking and documentation requirements
- The `customString1` field captures risk assessment references to ensure proper validation of exception criteria.

## Business Rules and Validation

**11. Temporal Conflicts:**
With date-effective status changes for both requisitions and positions, temporal conflicts are managed through:
- Effective dating logic that ensures workflow stages align with current position statuses
- Business rule alerts that block approval workflow advances when conflicting statuses exist
- The system prevents advancement when temporal inconsistencies occur until resolved through human intervention

**12. Funding Validation:**
Establishment control validation occurs at requisition creation through the `establishmentControl` field (Funded/Over-Establishment) and is reinforced by:
- The ServiceNow integration requiring approval status validation
- Periodic compliance reporting requirements
- Audit trail specifications that track ongoing funding compliance throughout the requisition lifecycle
- The `customBoolean1`: Over-Establishment Flag in position objects supports ongoing validation

The metadata extraction demonstrates a sophisticated approach to recruitment governance with comprehensive business rules, but as noted in the critique, requires validation of business rule syntax and correction of the future-dated timestamp to ensure implementation accuracy.
