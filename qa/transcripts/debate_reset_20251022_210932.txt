# CRITIQUE: Queensland DoE SAP SuccessFactors Leave Balance Specification

## **1. Accuracy Assessment**

### **Issues Identified:**
- **SAP SuccessFactors Time Off Capabilities Misunderstanding**: Your analysis suggests complex custom development is needed for basic leave calculations, but SuccessFactors Time Off has built-in accrual engines that handle advance leave, pro-rata calculations, and negative balances through standard configuration. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the platform's capabilities.

- **Integration Architecture Confusion**: You're treating EC, ECP, and BTP as separate systems when they're components of a unified SuccessFactors ecosystem. BTP isn't a separate data store but a middleware platform for integration services.

- **Academic Calendar Misconception**: SuccessFactors has standard academic calendar configurations for educational institutions. The "complex Queensland academic calendar" doesn't require custom development—it's configuration of existing academic calendar features.

### **Constructive Feedback:**
Focus on understanding SuccessFactors' standard capabilities before proposing custom solutions. The platform's Time Off module handles most Queensland DoE requirements through configuration rather than custom development.

## **2. Completeness Assessment**

### **Missing Critical Information:**

**Real-User Scenarios:**
- **Teacher Transfer Impact**: When a teacher moves between schools mid-year, how do leave balances from different employment periods consolidate? This happens daily in Queensland DoE.
- **Casual Relief Teacher Workflow**: How does a casual teacher with multiple school assignments track leave across different principals and employment conditions?
- **Parental Leave Return**: When a teacher returns from 12 months of parental leave, how are their leave balances recalculated based on their reduced FTE upon return?

**Business Process Gaps:**
- **Year-End Leave Processing**: What happens to 50,000+ teachers' leave balances during the 2-week Christmas break when most leave is taken?
- **Industrial Action Days**: How are strike days or work bans processed when they affect leave accrual calculations?
- **Sick Leave Medical Certification**: How does the system handle medical certificate validation and sick leave balance adjustments?

**Integration Scenarios:**
- **OneSchool System Synchronization**: How does leave approval in SuccessFactors trigger student allocation changes in OneSchool?
- **QSuper/ART Integration**: When a teacher's employment ends, how are leave payouts calculated and reported to superannuation funds?
- **WorkCover Claims**: How does an accepted workers' compensation claim pause or modify leave accrual calculations?

### **Constructive Feedback:**
Add real-world user journey scenarios. For example: "When Teacher Jane Smith (employee #12345) takes 5 days sick leave from Dec 15-19, 2025, across her 0.8 FTE assignment at Brisbane Grammar (School A) and 0.2 FTE at Brisbane State High (School B), the system must calculate leave usage proportionally while maintaining separate balances for each assignment."

## **3. Clarity Assessment**

### **Presentation Issues:**
- **Technical Jargon Overload**: Terms like "event-driven vs. point-to-point integration" and "data ownership governance" confuse rather than clarify for business stakeholders.
- **Academic Language**: Phrases like "substantial revision addressing fundamental business domain gaps" sound like consulting reports, not functional specifications that developers and business users can implement.
- **Matrix Overuse**: Tables with technical classifications don't translate well to actual system behavior.

### **Constructive Feedback:**
Write in user stories and acceptance criteria format. For example:
- **As a** school principal, **I want** to see my teachers' available leave balances **so that** I can plan coverage during school holidays.
- **Given** a teacher with multiple assignments, **When** they request leave, **Then** the system calculates usage proportionally across assignments.

## **Real-World Scenario Analysis - Missing from Your Work:**

### **Scenario 1: Multi-School Assignment Reality**
A Queensland teacher works 0.6 FTE at School A and 0.4 FTE at School B. They request 10 days leave. The system must:
- Calculate 6 days from School A allocation, 4 days from School B allocation
- Ensure both principals approve their portion
- Handle different leave policies if schools have different conditions
- Maintain consolidated employee view while respecting assignment boundaries

### **Scenario 2: Academic Calendar Complexity**
During the 2-week Christmas break, 80% of Queensland teachers take leave. The system must handle:
- Massive concurrent processing without performance degradation
- Year-end balance calculations while leave is being taken
- New year accrual resets while leave requests are pending
- Integration with school holiday calendars to prevent conflicts

### **Scenario 3: Casual Relief Teacher Reality**
A casual relief teacher works at 15 different schools throughout the year. Their leave:
- Accrues based on total hours worked across all assignments
- Must be tracked separately for each school's leave policy
- Requires real-time updates when they accept new assignments
- Needs to consolidate for end-of-year reporting

## **Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Start with User Personas**: Define specific Queensland DoE roles (teacher, principal, HR admin, payroll officer) and their exact needs.

2. **Use SuccessFactors Standard Terminology**: Replace technical jargon with SuccessFactors concepts like "Time Types," "Accrual Schedules," and "Time Accounts."

3. **Focus on Business Rules**: Instead of technical architecture debates, specify: "Teachers accrue 15 days personal leave per year, front-loaded from day 1, with additional accrual for service beyond 10 years."

4. **Include Error Scenarios**: "When a teacher transfers schools mid-leave period, the system must split the leave across old and new assignments proportionally."

5. **Address Peak Load Reality**: "During the 2 weeks before Christmas holidays, the system processes 40,000 leave requests simultaneously while maintaining <3 second response times."

Your current approach focuses too heavily on technical architecture debates rather than the actual business needs of Queensland teachers and administrators. The functional specification should describe WHAT the system must do for real users, not HOW you think it should be built.

================================================================================
Task 24
================================================================================
I can help with a rigorous, line-by-line fact-check of the HCMS documentation, focusing on SAP HXM and Azure components, integration patterns, governance, and cutover strategies. However, to produce an authoritative tabular verification with precise citations, access to current official documentation and peer-reviewed sources is needed. At the moment, I don’t have live tool access to fetch those sources. If you’d like, I can proceed in two ways:
- Option A: You can provide the specific statements from the HCMS materials you want verified, and I’ll validate each against official SAP and Microsoft references you confirm you have access to, then deliver the structured table with citations.
- Option B (preferred for complete, independent verification): I can guide you step-by-step on the exact sources to consult (SAP Help Portal, SAP Integration Suite docs, SAP Datasphere, SAP Cloud ALM, SAP Community, Microsoft Fabric and Purview docs, Azure DevOps docs, etc.), propose precise search queries, and then compile the results into the required table with proper citations once you share the retrieved material.

If you want me to proceed with Option B, here is a concrete plan you can implement to obtain verifiable sources and complete the table:

1) SAP HXM and integration tooling verification
- Confirm SuccessFactors Time Off capabilities and accrual logic in standard configuration.
- Verify SAP Cloud ALM and SAP Integration Suite capabilities for end-to-end lifecycle and integration flows.
- Validate SAP Datasphere/Data Sphere interoperability with SAP Analytics/Analytics Cloud and data provisioning patterns.
- Core sources to collect:
  - SAP Help Portal: Time Off in SuccessFactors, Accruals, Time Account, and Absence Management configuration.
  - SAP Integration Suite docs: Integration patterns, adapters, and BPM events.
  - SAP Cloud ALM documentation: Project management, test management, deployment, and ALM integration with BTP.

2) Microsoft Azure and integration patterns
- Confirm Azure Fabric architecture patterns for HR data, Purview governance, Sentinel security, and integration with SAP ecosystems.
- Validate Fabric HR RG Medallion architecture references and governance capabilities.
- Core sources to collect:
  - Microsoft Learn/Docs: Azure Fabric, Purview data governance, Sentinel security, DevOps integration with SAP ALM, and Terraform IaC guidance.
  - Official guidance on data sharing between SAP and Azure services (data provisioning, connectors, and live data strategies).

3) Governance, security, and compliance
- IS18:2018 and IPOLA cyber compliance standards (Australian context) and their applicability to the HCMS environment.
- Data governance requirements and data ownership between EC, ECP, and BTP, including data lineage and access controls.
- Core sources to collect:
  - ACSC and Australian standards sites (IS18 mappings, IPOLA references).
  - Australian government guidance on data governance and cloud security.
  - ISO/NIST mappings where relevant.

4) Cutover, parallel run, and deployment strategies
- Verify best practices for cutover in SAP SuccessFactors + Azure environments, parallel run strategies, and business continuity.
- Core sources to collect:
  - SAP Help Portal sections on cutover planning, go-live readiness, and parallel run considerations.
  - Microsoft and SAP integration guides on phased go-live and rollback procedures.

5) Specific scenarios and interoperability
- OpenText xECM/InfoArchive integration with SuccessFactors and Azure.
- Parallel payroll run capabilities involving TSS vs SAP ECP.
- Identity federation patterns with Ping/Entra ID, SAP IAS/IPS.
- Core sources to collect:
  - SAP and Microsoft docs on identity federation and SAML/OIDC with SAP and Azure AD/Entra ID.
  - Official integration guides for OpenText integrations where applicable.

Next steps
- If you provide the specific statements from your current HCMS analysis/spec, I’ll map each one to verified sources and deliver the requested table with:
  - Statement
  - Status
  - Evidence Summary
  - Source/Citation
  - HCMS-Specific Notes

Or I can draft the full verification table structure and fill it once you share the exact statements or permit me to fetch sources directly.

## Response to the Critique and Analysis

Thank you for the comprehensive critique. I appreciate the detailed feedback and will address the key concerns raised while maintaining focus on the specific requirements for the Queensland Department of Education's SAP SuccessFactors implementation.

### **Addressing the Platform Capabilities Concern**

You are absolutely correct that SAP SuccessFactors Time Off module has robust standard capabilities. However, the analysis was focused on the **specific integration and business rule complexity** unique to Queensland DoE's multi-school assignment model, not questioning the platform's core functionality.

**Standard SuccessFactors Capabilities Acknowledged:**
- Time Off module's accrual engines
- Pro-rata calculation features  
- Academic calendar configurations
- Time account management

**Where Custom Complexity Arises:**
The Queensland DoE scenario requires handling teachers with multiple concurrent assignments (e.g., 0.6 FTE at School A, 0.4 FTE at School B) where leave must be tracked and approved at the assignment level while maintaining employee-level aggregation - this goes beyond standard configuration and requires custom business logic.

### **Integration Architecture Clarification**

You are correct that my terminology was imprecise. Let me clarify:

- **Employee Central (EC)**: Core HR data store
- **Employee Central Payroll (ECP)**: Payroll processing component  
- **BTP (Business Technology Platform)**: Integration and middleware services
- **Not separate systems** but integrated components requiring clear data flow definitions

### **Real-World User Scenarios - Addressing the Gaps**

**Scenario 1: Multi-School Assignment Processing**
```
User Story: As a teacher with assignments at multiple schools, 
I want my leave to be allocated proportionally across assignments 
so that each school principal can approve leave for their portion.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given a teacher with 0.6 FTE at School A and 0.4 FTE at School B
- When they request 10 days leave
- Then 6 days are allocated against School A balance, 4 days against School B
- And both principals must approve their respective portions
- And the employee sees consolidated leave view
```

**Scenario 2: Academic Calendar Peak Processing**
```
User Story: As an HR administrator during year-end processing, 
I want the system to handle 40,000+ concurrent leave requests 
so that teachers can plan their Christmas break without system delays.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given 80% of 100K+ teachers taking leave during 2-week Christmas period
- When leave requests are submitted simultaneously with year-end calculations
- Then system maintains <3 second response times
- And leave balances update in real-time across all assignments
- And year-end accrual resets process without conflicts
```

### **Technical vs. Business Focus**

You're absolutely right that the focus should be on **WHAT the system must do** rather than excessive technical architecture debate. The core business requirements are:

1. **Multi-assignment leave tracking** - Assignment-level allocation with employee aggregation
2. **Real-time processing** - Immediate updates for teacher transfers and assignment changes  
3. **Academic calendar integration** - School-year specific leave policies and peak period management
4. **Proportional allocation** - FTE-based leave calculations across multiple employment points

### **Missing Context and Required Information**

The critique highlights critical missing information that must be gathered:

**Current State Assessment:**
- Existing leave management processes and pain points
- Volume statistics: Daily leave transactions, peak period loads
- Current approval workflows and stakeholder requirements

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Queensland Industrial Relations Act specific provisions
- Education sector enterprise bargaining agreement details
- WorkCover Queensland integration requirements

**Performance Requirements:**
- Real user scenarios with specific response time expectations
- Peak load processing requirements (Christmas period, term starts)
- Integration timing with payroll and external systems

### **Path Forward for Realize-Design Phase**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **User Persona Development** - Define specific roles (teachers, principals, HR admins, payroll staff) with exact requirements
2. **Business Rule Specification** - Document WHAT the system must do using SuccessFactors standard terminology
3. **Integration Flow Definition** - Map data flows using SuccessFactors standard integration patterns
4. **Performance SLA Definition** - Establish specific response time and throughput requirements

**SuccessFactors Standard Terminology Implementation:**
- Replace technical jargon with "Time Types," "Accrual Schedules," "Time Accounts"
- Use SuccessFactors configuration concepts rather than custom development assumptions
- Focus on standard Time Off module capabilities with Queensland-specific configuration

### **Conclusion**

The critique is valid - the analysis was too focused on technical architecture and not enough on the actual business needs of Queensland teachers and administrators. The functional specification should indeed describe WHAT the system must do for real users, using SuccessFactors standard capabilities wherever possible, with clear user stories and acceptance criteria.

The next phase should involve:
1. Detailed user persona and journey mapping
2. Business rule specification using SuccessFactors terminology  
3. Standard configuration approach with minimal custom development
4. Real-world scenario testing with Queensland DoE stakeholders

Thank you for the constructive feedback - it has highlighted the need to ground the technical analysis in actual business requirements and SuccessFactors platform capabilities.

Task 26
================================================================================
## Response to the Comprehensive Critique and Analysis

Thank you for the detailed and constructive critique. I'll address the specific concerns raised while providing clear, comprehensive answers to the questions and issues identified.

### **Platform Capabilities Understanding**

You correctly identified a fundamental misunderstanding in my initial analysis. I acknowledge that **SAP SuccessFactors Time Off module has robust standard capabilities** including:

- Built-in accrual engines with advance leave calculations
- Pro-rata calculation features for FTE adjustments  
- Standard academic calendar configurations for educational institutions
- Time account management with negative balance handling

**Correction Applied:** The Queensland DoE requirements can largely be met through standard SuccessFactors configuration rather than extensive custom development.

### **Integration Architecture Clarification**

Thank you for correcting my terminology. The proper understanding is:

- **Employee Central (EC)**: Core HR master data repository
- **Employee Central Payroll (ECP)**: Payroll processing engine within SuccessFactors suite
- **BTP (Business Technology Platform)**: Middleware platform providing integration services, not a separate data store
- **These are integrated components** requiring clear data flow definitions, not separate system architectures

### **Addressing the Core Business Scenarios**

**Multi-School Assignment Scenario (Corrected Approach):**
```
Standard SuccessFactors Configuration:
- Use Assignment records in EC to track multiple school positions
- Configure Time Types for each assignment with proportional allocation
- Set up Time Accounts at employee level with assignment-level tracking
- Utilize standard approval workflows with assignment-specific approvers
```

**Academic Calendar Integration:**
```
Standard Configuration:
- Use SuccessFactors Academic Calendar feature
- Configure school-year specific leave policies
- Set up term-based accrual schedules
- Configure holiday calendars specific to Queensland school terms
```

### **Real-World User Scenarios - SuccessFactors Approach**

**Scenario 1: Teacher Transfer Between Schools**
```
SuccessFactors Standard Process:
Given: Teacher Jane Smith transfers from Brisbane Grammar to Brisbane State High
When: EC assignment record is updated with new school and FTE
Then: Time Off module automatically recalculates leave allocation based on new assignment
And: Historical leave balances from previous assignment are maintained
And: New assignment leave entitlements are calculated from transfer date
```

**Scenario 2: Casual Relief Teacher with Multiple Assignments**
```
SuccessFactors Standard Process:
Given: Casual teacher works at 15 different schools throughout the year
When: Assignment records are created for each school engagement
Then: Time Off module creates proportional leave allocation based on hours worked
And: Each assignment maintains separate time tracking while consolidating at employee level
And: Standard SuccessFactors reporting provides consolidated views
```

**Scenario 3: Year-End Processing for 100K+ Teachers**
```
SuccessFactors Standard Process:
Given: 80% of Queensland teachers taking leave during Christmas break
When: Academic calendar triggers year-end processes
Then: Standard SuccessFactors batch processing handles bulk operations
And: Accrual resets and new year allocations process through standard workflows
And: Performance optimized through SuccessFactors standard load balancing
```

### **Critical Information Gaps Identified**

Based on the critique, here are the essential missing elements that must be gathered:

**1. Current State Assessment:**
- Existing leave management processes and pain points
- Volume statistics: Daily/monthly leave transactions, peak period loads
- Current approval workflows and stakeholder requirements
- Legacy system integration requirements

**2. Queensland-Specific Requirements:**
- Queensland Industrial Relations Act provisions
- Education sector Enterprise Bargaining Agreement details

**3. Performance Requirements:**
- Peak load processing during Christmas break (40,000+ concurrent requests)
- Real-time processing for teacher transfers and assignment changes
- Integration timing with payroll and external systems
- Response time SLAs (<3 seconds during normal operations)

### **Corrected Technical Approach**

**SuccessFactors Standard Configuration Strategy:**
1. **Time Types Configuration**: Set up Queensland-specific leave types (Personal, Annual, Long Service, etc.)
2. **Accrual Schedules**: Configure based on Queensland Industrial Relations requirements
3. **Assignment Management**: Use EC assignment records for multi-school tracking
4. **Approval Workflows**: Configure assignment-specific approval chains with employee-level oversight
5. **Academic Calendar**: Utilize standard academic calendar features for term-based processing

**Integration Pattern (Corrected):**
- Use SuccessFactors standard integration patterns (SAP Integration Suite)
- Leverage standard EC-ECP integration for payroll-related leave processing
- Utilize standard BTP services for external system integration
- Maintain data consistency through SuccessFactors standard sync mechanisms

### **User Personas and Requirements (SuccessFactors-Focused)**

**Primary User Personas:**
1. **Classroom Teacher**: Needs easy leave request process, clear balance visibility
2. **School Principal**: Requires assignment-specific approval capabilities
3. **HR Administrator**: Needs consolidated reporting and compliance monitoring
4. **Payroll Officer**: Requires integration with payroll processing for leave payments

### **Success Criteria for Realize-Design Phase**

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ Multi-school assignment leave tracking using standard SuccessFactors features
- ✅ Queensland academic calendar integration through standard configuration
- ✅ Real-time leave balance updates across all assignment types
- ✅ Standard approval workflows with assignment-specific routing

**Performance Requirements:**
- ✅ <3 second response times during peak periods (Christmas break)
- ✅ Concurrent processing of 40,000+ leave requests
- ✅ Real-time updates for assignment changes and transfers
- ✅ Standard SuccessFactors uptime and availability SLAs

### **Immediate Action Items**

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Conduct detailed workshops with Queensland DoE stakeholders using SuccessFactors terminology
2. **Configuration Design**: Create detailed configuration specifications using SuccessFactors standard features
3. **Integration Mapping**: Map integration requirements to SuccessFactors standard integration patterns
4. **Performance Testing**: Define performance requirements based on actual Queensland DoE volumes
5. **User Acceptance**: Develop user stories in SuccessFactors standard format with clear acceptance criteria

### **Final Acknowledgment**

The critique was absolutely correct - my initial analysis was too focused on custom technical architecture and insufficiently grounded in SuccessFactors standard capabilities and actual business requirements. The functional specification should describe WHAT the system must do for Queensland teachers and administrators using SuccessFactors standard terminology and configuration approaches, not custom development assumptions.

The path forward is clear: leverage SuccessFactors standard Time Off capabilities with Queensland-specific configuration, focus on real user needs, and ensure the solution addresses the actual business requirements of Queensland's educational workforce.

Task 28
================================================================================
## Comprehensive Response to the Queensland DoE SAP SuccessFactors Implementation Questions

Thank you for the detailed critique and analysis. I'll provide clear, comprehensive answers addressing the specific questions and concerns raised while focusing on the actual business requirements and SuccessFactors standard capabilities.

### **Platform Capabilities and Architecture Clarification**

**Question: What are the actual SuccessFactors Time Off capabilities versus custom development needs?**

**Answer:** SuccessFactors Time Off module provides robust standard functionality:
- Built-in accrual engines supporting advance leave and pro-rata calculations
- Academic calendar configurations for educational institutions
- Time account management with negative balance handling
- Standard approval workflows and reporting capabilities

**Custom Complexity Arises From:** Queensland DoE's multi-school assignment model where teachers work across multiple schools simultaneously (e.g., 0.6 FTE at School A, 0.4 FTE at School B) requiring assignment-level leave tracking with employee-level aggregation - this extends beyond standard single-assignment configurations.

### **Multi-School Assignment Business Logic**

**Question: How should leave be handled for teachers with multiple school assignments?**

**Answer:** Using SuccessFactors standard features:
```
Standard Configuration Approach:
- EC Assignment Records: Track each school assignment separately
- Time Types: Configure per assignment with proportional allocation
- Time Accounts: Employee-level with assignment-level detail
- Approval Workflows: Assignment-specific principal approval with employee oversight
```

**Real-World Example:**
- Teacher with 0.6 FTE at School A and 0.4 FTE at School B requests 10 days leave
- System allocates 6 days against School A balance, 4 days against School B balance
- Both principals approve their respective portions
- Employee sees consolidated leave view

### **Academic Calendar and Peak Processing**

**Question: How does the system handle Queensland's academic calendar and peak periods?**

**Answer:** SuccessFactors standard academic calendar features with Queensland-specific configuration:
- Term-based accrual schedules aligned with Queensland school calendar
- Holiday calendar integration to prevent leave conflicts during school breaks
- Standard batch processing for year-end operations during Christmas break
- Performance optimization through SuccessFactors standard load balancing

**Peak Processing Requirements:**
- 80% of 100K+ teachers taking leave during 2-week Christmas period
- <3 second response times maintained during 40,000+ concurrent requests
- Bulk operations for year-end accrual resets and new year calculations

### **Integration Architecture Clarification**

**Question: What is the correct relationship between EC, ECP, and BTP?**

**Answer:** Correct understanding:
- **Employee Central (EC)**: Core HR master data repository
- **Employee Central Payroll (ECP)**: Payroll processing engine within SuccessFactors suite
- **BTP (Business Technology Platform)**: Middleware providing integration services, not separate data store
- **Integration**: Standard SuccessFactors integration patterns using SAP Integration Suite

### **Real-World User Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Teacher Transfer Between Schools**
```
SuccessFactors Standard Process:
Given: Teacher transfers from one school to another
When: EC assignment record is updated with new school and FTE
Then: Time Off module recalculates leave allocation based on new assignment
And: Historical balances from previous assignment are maintained
And: New assignment entitlements calculated from transfer date
```

**Scenario 2: Casual Relief Teacher Management**
```
SuccessFactors Standard Process:
Given: Casual teacher works at multiple schools throughout the year
When: Assignment records created for each school engagement
Then: Time Off creates proportional allocation based on hours worked
And: Each assignment maintains separate tracking while consolidating employee view
And: Standard reporting provides consolidated views across all assignments
```

### **Performance and Scalability Requirements**

**Question: What performance standards must be met for 100K+ employees?**

**Answer:** Specific performance requirements:
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds during normal operations
- **Peak Load**: Concurrent processing of 40,000+ leave requests during Christmas break
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate processing for assignment changes and transfers
- **Batch Processing**: Year-end operations for 100K+ employees during school breaks
- **Availability**: Standard SuccessFactors SLAs with Queensland DoE specific uptime needs

### **Integration Touchpoints**

**Question: What external systems need integration?**

**Answer:** Key integration points:
1. **OneSchool System**: Leave approval triggers student allocation changes
2. **QSuper/ART**: Employment end processing and superannuation reporting
3. **WorkCover Queensland**: Workers' compensation claims affecting leave accruals
4. **Payroll Systems**: Integration for leave payment calculations and processing

### **User Personas and Requirements**

**Primary User Personas:**
1. **Classroom Teacher**: Easy leave request process, clear balance visibility
2. **School Principal**: Assignment-specific approval capabilities
3. **HR Administrator**: Consolidated reporting, compliance monitoring
4. **Payroll Officer**: Integration with payroll for accurate leave payments

### **Business Rules Configuration**

**Queensland-Specific Requirements:**
- **Multi-Assignment Allocation**: Proportional leave based on FTE across assignments
- **Academic Calendar**: Term-based accruals, holiday restrictions
- **Casual Relief Rules**: Accrual based on total hours across all assignments
- **Approval Hierarchies**: Assignment-specific principal approval required

### **Error Scenarios and Exception Handling**

**Critical Exception Scenarios:**
1. **Mid-Leave Transfer**: Split leave across old and new assignments proportionally
2. **Industrial Action**: Process strike days/work bans affecting accrual calculations
3. **Parental Leave Return**: Recalculate balances based on new FTE upon return
4. **Medical Certification**: Handle sick leave with medical certificate validation

### **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**

**Queensland-Specific Compliance:**
- Queensland Industrial Relations Act provisions
- Education sector Enterprise Bargaining Agreement details
- WorkCover Queensland integration requirements
- Queensland government data protection standards
- Audit trail and compliance reporting needs

### **Path Forward for Realize-Design Phase**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Requirements Validation**: Confirm actual business needs with Queensland DoE stakeholders
2. **Configuration Design**: Create detailed SuccessFactors standard configuration specifications
3. **Performance Testing**: Define requirements based on actual Queensland DoE volumes
4. **User Acceptance**: Develop user stories in SuccessFactors standard format
5. **Integration Mapping**: Map to SuccessFactors standard integration patterns

### **Success Criteria**

**Functional Success:**
- ✅ Multi-school assignment tracking using standard SuccessFactors features
- ✅ Queensland academic calendar integration through standard configuration
- ✅ Real-time processing for assignment changes and transfers
- ✅ Standard approval workflows with assignment-specific routing

**Performance Success:**
- ✅ <3 second response times during peak periods
- ✅ Concurrent processing of 40,000+ requests during Christmas break
- ✅ Standard SuccessFactors uptime and availability requirements
- ✅ Real-time updates for assignment changes and transfers

This approach leverages SuccessFactors standard capabilities while addressing Queensland DoE's specific business requirements, ensuring the solution focuses on actual user needs rather than technical architecture debates.
