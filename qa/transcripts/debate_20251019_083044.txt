Topic: E023 – AUTO CREATION OF NET OFFSET FOR OVERPAYMENTS OVER
THRESHOLD
Overpayments are prevalent at DoE and as such an extension is required to reduce the overpayment
administration as much as possible with a view to standardising the treatment of overpayments and
subsequent repayments.
Current State
TSS has within it a custom-built Overpayments portal that allows for an administrator view to process
overpayments detected as part of the current payroll process. In certain circumstances the overpayments
can be auto recovered (e.g. retrospective adjustment of leave); however generally the process will assess
each individual overpayment and where required send notification to the employee advising them of the
overpayment and suggested repayment plan. In many cases a payroll advisor will take some time in
explaining the reasons why the overpayment has occurred.
Currently at DoE the offset that is loaded is gross, with the Tax and Superannuation being adjusted with
the repayment.
Future State - Out of The Box
SAP Payroll, by default, will automatically recover any overpayments through it’s in built retro-accounting
function. Furthermore, Overpayments can easily be identified through the Payroll Control Centre however,
the Out of The Box solution would be a manual process to load an offsetting payment to stop the
overpayment being recovered before first contacting the employee to arrange a repayment plan.
Enhancement Considerations
For the purposes of this BTP Extension an overpayment should be considered as a negative influx of
dollars into the current pay period that had been paid in a previous pay period.
In order to automate the process to reduce the administrative overhead, the enhancement should
consider:
􀍻 Identification that an Overpayment has occurred.
􀍻 Creation of an Offset wage type
􀍻 Creation of an Overpayment Total
􀍻 Creation of an Overpayment Repayment Deduction
􀍻 Reporting Requirements
The other consideration of this enhancement is at what point should the system add the offset given
further master data changes may occur throughout the pay process. This could either be embedded
within the payroll processing or run as a stand-alone payroll process. Accurately being able to predict the
number of overpayments in the new system, then the recommendation would be to run this as a separate
step in the payroll process so if it was decided that the numbers didn’t justify the automation then it would
be at the Payroll Manager’s discretion to run it and not require further configuration changes to the payroll.

Within ECP, Employees with an overpayment can distinctly be identified through the existence of Wage
Type ‘/652 – Stat Net Post Deduction’ in the current pay period results table.
A custom table will be required to store a $ threshold per employee / worker type in order to determine if
an offset is required, or whether the $ amount falls below the threshold and can be auto recovered.
The matrix to store the dollar threshold against employee cohort will be provided during the
implementation but must include the ability to make date-effective changes.
If the overpayment exceeds the relevant threshold, then the program will create a Net Offset equal to the
amount of the Overpayment (/652).
Whilst there is an option to create the offset in either EC or directly in ECP, the recommendation would be
to create directly in ECP (using a dedicated number range) thereby easily identifying offsets created via
this program as opposed to a manual process.
The creation of the net offset prevents the employee from paying back the overpayment in the current pay
period, however further entries are required to set up the overpayment for future pay periods.
To that end, ECP can control the overpayment through Reducing Balance Deductions, whereby a ‘Total
Debt’ wage type is created to store the full overpayment, and an associated recurring deduction is set up
to pay an amount each pay period until such time as the debt is fully repaid.
The calculation logic for the Deduction Amount will be provided by DoE during the implementation.
In scenarios where, even above threshold, employees agree to pay back the overpayment in the current
pay, the offset should be removed and pay re-run. Similarly, any total debt and repayment created as part
of the process should also be deleted.
To avoid the chance of too much rework, the extension should be designed so that the creation of the
offset occurs within the Pre Payroll or Live Payroll process however the creation of the subsequent debt
and repayment can be done in the Post Payroll step.
