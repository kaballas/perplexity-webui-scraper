## Standard Auto-Increment Capability

**Pay Scale Progression** in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central automates movement of employees to the next higher pay scale level based on eligibility rules.

### Implementation Components

**Off Cycle Event Batch**: MDF object selecting employees meeting filter criteria and passing records to business rules for processing. Filters use date calculations with offset values to identify eligibility dates.

**Business Rules**: Configure IF-THEN logic checking eligibility criteria maintained in custom fields on the Pay Scale Level object (e.g., "Membership Duration for Progression in Months"). Rules update Job Information with new pay scale level and trigger cross-portlet rules to update Compensation Information.

**Pay Scale Pay Increase Run**: Background job performing mass compensation updates when pay rates change across pay scale structures. Processes onSave rules on Job Information and onChange rules on pay components.

### Standard Eligibility Criteria

**Membership period**: Duration in current pay scale level calculated from Pay Scale Level Entry Date field. Example: 9 months at Level 1, 12 months at Level 2, 24 months at Level 3.

**Age-based progression**: Custom field on Pay Scale Level captures minimum age requirements with business rules deriving employee age from birth date.

**Actual hours worked**: Configurable for jurisdictions using hours-based thresholds rather than calendar time.

***

## Public Sector Gaps

### LWOP Suspension

**Requirement**: Australian Public Sector awards require increment progression to **pause** during Leave Without Pay periods. The Pay Scale Level Entry Date must be **extended** by the duration of LWOP to maintain accurate service calculation.

**Standard limitation**: Off Cycle Event Batch filters calculate membership duration using simple date arithmetic (Current Date - Pay Scale Level Entry Date). No standard mechanism exists to:

- Detect LWOP periods from Time Off or absence records
- Automatically adjust Pay Scale Level Entry Date to exclude LWOP days
- Recalculate increment eligibility dates when employees return from LWOP
- Handle retrospective LWOP approvals requiring increment date corrections

**Workaround documented**: Custom flag "Process Auto Pay Grade Change" on Job Information can manually exclude employees from progression. SAP documentation states: "Customer needs to identify as part of the business process when to set and reset this field for exception employees. For e.g., set the flag when LOA event is initiated for an employee and reset the flag after employee returns from LOA".

**Gap**: Manual flag management is **insufficient** for complex LWOP scenarios requiring automatic date adjustments and pro-rata calculations.

***

### Higher Duties Acceleration

**Requirement**: Public sector awards specify that time spent on higher duties **counts toward** increment progression in both the higher duties position **and** the substantive position. Queensland Directive 16/24 states: "Where an employee is performing higher duties across awards, the period of higher duties will count towards the increment in the employee's substantive position".

Additionally, higher duties at certain levels may **accelerate** progression by accruing service faster than standard time (e.g., 18-month rule adjustments where extended HD periods trigger catch-up progressions).

**Standard limitation**: Pay Scale Progression processes **single** Job Information records with one Pay Scale Level Entry Date. When Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment creates **concurrent employment** records, standard logic does not:

- Aggregate service time from both substantive and HD positions
- Apply HD service periods to substantive increment calculations
- Update substantive Pay Scale Level Entry Date when HD assignment ends
- Calculate accelerated progression eligibility based on HD duration thresholds

**Victoria PS guidance**: "An Employee who meets the eligibility requirements of the Agreement for the higher grade...will be eligible to receive progression...for the higher classified position. The substantive salary is also increased to the next progression step/amount". This dual progression logic is **not supported** by standard Off Cycle Event Batch configuration.

***

### Award Complexity

**Requirement**: Australian awards contain multi-factor increment rules including:

- **Performance-based gating**: Progression contingent on performance ratings meeting defined thresholds (e.g., "Met" or "Exceeded" required for increment)
- **18-month rule**: Employees promoted/transferred ineligible for progression for specified periods, with catch-up provisions if extended beyond 18 months
- **Pro-rata adjustments**: Partial-year increments for employees starting mid-cycle or returning from extended leave
- **Top-of-grade payments**: Employees at maximum pay scale level receiving percentage-based payments instead of increments
- **Acting arrangements**: Temporary appointments with different increment rules than permanent appointments

**Standard limitation**: Business Rules support **single-criterion** eligibility checks (IF membership duration >= threshold THEN increment). Complex conditional logic requiring **multiple simultaneous factors** (performance rating AND absence history AND promotion history AND HD status) exceeds practical Business Rule complexity limits.

Off Cycle Event Batch filters operate with **OR logic** between multiple conditions. Award rules requiring **AND logic** across disparate data sources (Time Off + Performance Management + Job Information + Custom MDF) cannot be expressed in standard filter configurations.

***

## Custom Enhancement Requirements

### LWOP Integration

**Solution architecture**:

**Integration Center scheduled job**: Nightly query of Time Off absence records for LWOP types. For each active LWOP period, calculate accumulated LWOP days since last Pay Scale Level Entry Date.

**Business Rule extension**: Modify standard progression rule to include LWOP adjustment:

```
adjusted_service_days = (TODAY - pay_scale_level_entry_date) - total_lwop_days_since_entry
IF adjusted_service_days >= (membership_duration_months * 30) THEN increment
```

**Absence event trigger**: Configure workflow on LWOP absence submission to automatically set "Process Auto Pay Grade Change = No" flag, preventing premature progression during leave. Removal workflow on return-to-work event recalculates entry date and resets flag.

***

### Higher Duties Service Aggregation

**Solution architecture**:

**Custom MDF object**: `SubstantiveServiceTracker` storing:
- Employee ID
- Substantive position Pay Scale Level Entry Date
- Accumulated HD service days (updated by Integration Center when HD assignments end)
- Adjusted increment eligibility date

**HD termination workflow**: When Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment ends via Right to Return, trigger Integration Center flow calculating HD duration and updating SubstantiveServiceTracker.

**Business Rule modification**: Reference `SubstantiveServiceTracker` instead of Job Information Pay Scale Level Entry Date for substantive position progression calculations:

```
total_service = (TODAY - substantive_entry_date) + accumulated_hd_days
IF total_service >= eligibility_threshold THEN increment_substantive_position
```

***

### Multi-Criteria Award Rules

**Solution architecture**:

**Custom calculated fields**: Create Boolean flags on Job Information for complex eligibility checks:
- `eligible_for_progression` (combining performance, tenure, absence checks)
- `18_month_rule_applies`
- `top_of_grade_payment_due`

**BTP custom application**: Build eligibility calculation service in Extension Center consuming OData APIs for:
- Performance Management ratings
- Time Off LWOP totals
- Promotion/transfer history
- HD concurrent employment records

Service exposes calculated eligibility flags via custom OData entity consumed by Business Rules.

**SBPA workflow**: Automate exception handling for 18-month rule adjustments, top-of-grade payments, and manual review queues for borderline cases.

***

## Implementation Recommendations

**Phase 1 - LWOP Handling**: Implement Integration Center LWOP aggregation with Business Rule adjustments for date calculations. Estimated effort: Medium complexity.

**Phase 2 - HD Service Credit**: Deploy SubstantiveServiceTracker MDF with HD termination workflow integration. Estimated effort: Medium-high complexity.

**Phase 3 - Award Rule Engine**: Develop BTP custom service for multi-criteria eligibility with SBPA exception workflows. Estimated effort: High complexity.

**Alternative approach**: For organizations with deep SAP ECC integration, leverage on-premise payroll calculations for increment eligibility determination with BAdI replication to SuccessFactors. This centralizes complex award logic in the payroll system.
