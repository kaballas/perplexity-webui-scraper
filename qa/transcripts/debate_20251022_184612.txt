TASK: Explain "Employee Consolidated Leave Request Specification"
================================================================================

================================================================================
Task 1
================================================================================
Based on the provided contexts, the **Employee Consolidated Leave Request Specification** refers to a system enhancement that allows employees with multiple concurrent assignments to manage their leave requests more efficiently. Here's what it encompasses:

## Core Functionality
The specification enables employees with concurrent employment to **request leave across all their assignments in one screen**, eliminating the need for separate processes for each assignment.

## Current vs. Future State

### Current State:
- DoE employees can create consolidated leave requests within the current MyHR Self Service Portal depending on their multiple assignment type
- However, employees with multiple assignments on different awards cannot use consolidated leave requests because they require separate logins for each assignment
- No consolidated request function currently exists for all scenarios

### Future State:
- Employees would need to create separate requests for each assignment (current limitation)
- Managers must approve requests separately for each assignment

## Key Features

### 1. **Consolidated Balance Display**
- Utilizes SAP Build App extension to show an employee's leave balance across all assignments
- Displays Position Title to help employees understand the presented data
- Provides consolidated balance view across all assignments

### 2. **On Behalf Of Functionality**
- Allows managers or admin services to make leave requests on behalf of employees
- Uses consolidated balance across all assignments
- Utilizes SAP BTP App extension

### 3. **Workflow Management**
- Auto-creation of workflow requests to multiple approvers across all employee assignments affected by the leave
- Handles multiple approvers and delegates automatically

## Enhancement Considerations
- Combining work schedules across all assignments for consolidated leave requests
- Validation for different eligibility requirements for various leave types across different assignments
- Integration with different awards and employment conditions

## Related Functionality
The specification also addresses **Leave Request with Unpaid Units (E004b)**, allowing employees to combine paid and unpaid leave units when they have insufficient paid leave balance, with the option to accept leave requests containing some unpaid units (LWOP).

This specification represents a significant improvement in leave management for employees with complex employment arrangements, streamlining what is currently a fragmented process.
