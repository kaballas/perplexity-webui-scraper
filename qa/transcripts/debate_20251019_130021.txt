Topic: ENH-01	Enhancement	Management of Position FTE at Org Level	Medium	33		"Standard SAP only manages FTE at a position level not at an Organisation Unit level.
As specified in the requirements, a custom solution is required to alert users during position creation/change if the organisation level FTE is exceeded. Alternative is to manage org FTE using reporitng. "

Round 1 - AskQuestions
================================================================================
As a curious inquirer, I'd like to ask several clarifying questions about this FTE management enhancement:

**Technical Architecture & Integration:**
- How will the custom FTE validation at org unit level interact with existing position control mechanisms? Could there be conflicts between position-level FTE enforcement and org unit-level validation?
- What specific triggers will activate the FTE cap validation - is it only during position creation/changes, or does it also monitor real-time FTE calculations as incumbents are assigned/removed?

**Business Process & User Experience:**
- When the system detects an FTE cap violation at the org unit level, what happens to the position creation/change workflow? Is it blocked, or does it require additional approval?
- How will the system handle time-dependent FTE calculations, given that positions and assignments have start/end dates that could affect org unit FTE totals over time?

**Operational Considerations:**
- What's the expected performance impact of real-time FTE validation across multiple organizational units, especially during high-volume position management activities?
- How will the system handle organizational restructures or bulk position changes that could temporarily exceed FTE caps but are part of a planned transition?

**Governance & Compliance:**
- Are there different FTE cap rules for different organizational levels or types within the hierarchy, or is this consistent across all org units?
- How will audit trails be maintained for FTE cap exceptions or overrides to ensure compliance with budgeted FTE allocations?

These questions aim to explore the practical implications and potential edge cases of implementing this enhancement.

Round 2 - AnswerQuestions
================================================================================
Thank you for these excellent and comprehensive questions about the FTE management enhancement. I'll address each area systematically based on the technical requirements and design considerations.

## Technical Architecture & Integration

**Interaction with existing position control mechanisms:**
The custom FTE validation at the org unit level will operate as a WRICEF Enhancement that supplements existing position control mechanisms rather than replacing them. There will be a layered validation approach:
- Position-level FTE enforcement will continue to operate for individual position budgeted vs. actual FTE
- Org unit-level validation will aggregate FTE across all positions within the organizational unit
- The system will use custom fields in Employee Central to track both position-specific and organizational unit FTE totals
- Potential conflicts will be managed through a validation hierarchy where org unit validation acts as an additional check before position-level validation

**Validation triggers:**
The FTE cap validation will be activated by multiple events:
- Position creation (primary trigger for the enhancement)
- Position FTE modifications (changes to budgeted FTE values)
- Incumbent assignment/removal (real-time FTE calculation updates)
- Organizational unit reassignments (when positions move between org units)
- The validation will operate in real-time through PeopleForms integration and Azure DataHub synchronization

## Business Process & User Experience

**Workflow behavior upon violation detection:**
When the system detects an FTE cap violation, the position creation workflow will be **blocked** with the following user experience:
- A clear warning message will display the current FTE total, the proposed increase, and the remaining available FTE capacity
- The system will prevent the position save until either the FTE is reduced or proper exception approval is obtained
- For planned exceptions, a separate approval workflow will be triggered to document business justification
- The validation will be configurable to allow different behaviors (warning vs. hard block) based on organizational unit type

**Time-dependent FTE calculations:**
The system will handle temporal FTE calculations through:
- Date-effective FTE calculations that consider position and assignment start/end dates
- Rolling FTE totals that account for positions that may be active in the future or have past end dates
- Scenario planning capabilities that allow users to model FTE impacts over time
- The Azure DataHub integration will maintain historical FTE data for trend analysis and forecasting

## Operational Considerations

**Performance impact:**
The real-time validation architecture includes several performance optimization strategies:
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed org unit FTE totals
- Asynchronous processing for complex multi-level FTE calculations
- Database indexing on organizational unit hierarchies and FTE-related fields
- Batch processing capabilities for high-volume scenarios during month-end closing
- The system will be designed to handle validation within 2-3 seconds for standard use cases

**Organizational restructuring handling:**
For bulk changes and restructures, the system will include:
- A "planned state" mode that allows temporary cap exceedances during restructuring
- Workflow-based exception handling for approved organizational changes
- Rollback capabilities if restructuring plans change
- Parallel processing of FTE calculations during bulk operations to maintain system responsiveness

## Governance & Compliance

**Different FTE cap rules by organizational level:**
Yes, the system will support configurable FTE cap rules including:
- Different cap types (budgeted vs. approved vs. actual) at various organizational levels
- Variations based on organizational unit type (schools vs. regional offices vs. central administration)
- Time-based rule variations (fiscal year vs. calendar year considerations)
- Exception rules for special circumstances (emergency staffing, temporary assignments)
- The Configuration Workbook will document these variations and their application logic

**Audit trail maintenance:**
Comprehensive audit capabilities will include:
- Complete change history for all FTE-related modifications
- User identification and timestamp for all FTE cap violations and overrides
- Business justification capture for any approved exceptions
- Automated compliance reporting through Microsoft Fabric integration
- Integration with existing audit frameworks within the Queensland DoE environment
- Export capabilities for external audit requirements

The integration with Azure DataHub ensures that all validation logic and audit trails are maintained consistently across the hybrid architecture, supporting both real-time operational needs and long-term compliance requirements.

These design considerations ensure the enhancement provides robust FTE cap validation while maintaining system performance and supporting the complex organizational structure of the Queensland Department of Education.
