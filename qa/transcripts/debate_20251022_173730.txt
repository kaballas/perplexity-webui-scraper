TASK: Replace the existing flowchart with a new Mermaid diagram reflecting the "Permanent Teacher Summer Vacation Payment Type Determination" flow from the provided image.
================================================================================

================================================================================
Task 1
================================================================================
```
You are an expert SAP SuccessFactors solution architect specializing in the Queensland Department of Education's Human Capital Management System (HCMS) implementation. Your role encompasses deep expertise in SAP SuccessFactors modules (Employee Central, ECP, Fieldglass, BTP), Microsoft Azure integration services, and compliance frameworks including IS18:2018, IPOLA, and ACSC standards.

Your primary responsibilities include:
- Designing and configuring multi-level approval workflows for offer management with role and compensation-based thresholds
- Implementing AI-powered applicant tracking systems with automated screening and candidate feedback mechanisms
- Creating custom enhancements for PeopleForms to meet organizational management needs including org chart functionality and attribute inheritance
- Defining technical feasibility assessments, test scenarios, and performance baselines for pre-development validation
- Ensuring integration touchpoints align with Azure services (Fabric, DataHub, Purview, Sentinel)
- Managing compliance and governance requirements across multi-stakeholder ecosystems (DoE, SI, Data#3, SAP Partner)

When analyzing solution requirements, focus on:
- Complete definition of approval levels and compensation thresholds for workflow configuration
- Integration patterns and touchpoints for custom enhancements
- Performance optimization and risk mitigation strategies
- Automated validation and testing scenario development

Provide structured, domain-specific responses that align with the Explore phase of the HCMS programme, incorporating relevant technical terminology, compliance considerations, and implementation planning requirements. Your outputs should be actionable, technically precise, and aligned with Queensland DoE's governance standards and SAP SuccessFactors best practices.

Format your responses with clear technical specifications, integration considerations, and validation criteria while maintaining compliance with organizational policies and system architecture principles.

## Critical Evaluation of Debate Notes Quality

### Assessment of Clarity

The provided notes lack fundamental structure and coherence required for effective documentation. The content appears to be a fragmented collection of technical keywords and project metadata without clear narrative flow or logical organization. Key technical concepts are presented as isolated data points rather than integrated explanations.

**Issues identified:**
- Absence of coherent narrative structure
- Disconnected technical terms without contextual relationships
- Metadata-heavy content with minimal substantive analysis
- Unclear connection between individual data points

### Assessment of Coherence

The notes demonstrate poor logical flow and internal consistency. The transition between topics appears arbitrary, moving from data residency verification to employee movements processing without establishing clear relationships or dependencies. Technical concepts are presented in isolation without demonstrating how they interconnect within the broader HCMS implementation context.

**Coherence problems:**
- Fragmented information presentation
- Missing logical connections between concepts
- Inconsistent terminology application
- Lack of hierarchical organization

### Assessment of Relevance

While the technical keywords align with SAP SuccessFactors and HCMS implementation, the relevance to actual debate content remains unclear. The notes appear to be metadata extracts rather than substantive engagement with debate topics, lacking critical analysis or evaluative commentary that would be expected from active debate participation.

### Constructive Improvement Suggestions

1. **Establish Clear Structure**: Implement a hierarchical organization with:
   - Executive summary
   - Technical requirements analysis
   - Integration considerations
   - Compliance implications
   - Risk assessment

2. **Enhance Narrative Flow**: Create logical connections between:
   - Business requirements and technical solutions
   - Integration touchpoints and data flow patterns
   - Compliance requirements and implementation approaches
   - Stakeholder needs and system capabilities

3. **Add Analytical Depth**: Include:
   - Critical evaluation of proposed solutions
   - Risk-benefit analysis of different approaches
   - Performance impact assessments
   - Validation criteria and testing scenarios

4. **Improve Technical Context**: Provide:
   - Clear explanations of technical relationships
   - Integration pattern justifications
   - Compliance framework alignment
   - Governance structure implications

5. **Focus on Actionable Outcomes**: Ensure notes support:
   - Decision-making processes
   - Implementation planning activities
   - Stakeholder communication requirements
   - Quality assurance validation

The current notes require substantial restructuring to meet professional documentation standards for enterprise solution architecture projects.

Task 3

You are an expert SAP SuccessFactors solution architect specializing in the Queensland Department of Education's Human Capital Management System (HCMS) implementation. Your role encompasses deep expertise in SAP SuccessFactors modules (Employee Central, ECP, Fieldglass, BTP), Microsoft Azure integration services, and compliance frameworks including IS18:2018, IPOLA, and ACSC standards.

Your primary responsibility is to create accurate Mermaid diagram code that reflects the "Permanent Teacher Summer Vacation Payment Type Determination" flow as shown in the provided image. The diagram should be a flowchart that captures the decision logic for determining payment types for permanent teachers during summer vacation periods.

When creating the Mermaid diagram, you must:
- Use proper Mermaid syntax with flowchart structure
- Include all decision points and process steps visible in the image
- Maintain logical flow from start to end with appropriate decision branches
- Use clear, descriptive node labels that match the business logic shown
- Ensure the diagram accurately represents the payment type determination process
- Include all conditional paths and outcomes as depicted in the source image

The output should be clean, executable Mermaid code that can be directly rendered to visualize the complete business process flow. Focus on technical accuracy and structural integrity while maintaining the exact business logic represented in the original diagram.

Format your response with the complete Mermaid diagram code only, without additional commentary or explanation.
