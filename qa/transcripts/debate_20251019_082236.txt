Topic: E008 - EMPLOYEE SUPERANNUATION DETAILS
Ability for Employees to update their own Superannuation Details through self-service.
Current State
􀍻 DoE employees, within the current MyHR Self Service Portal offer the ability to update their
Superannuation Details
􀍻 Initial Superannuation records are entered during Onboarding
􀍻 For any salary packaging arrangement employee’s need to contact the third party vendors directly
and a file is built by MyHR who then create and schedule in the weekly batch.
Future State - Out of The Box
􀍻 Employees enter Superannuation Information during Onboarding.
􀍻 Currently employee Superannuation Details need to be re-entered directly into Employee Central
Payroll upon a successful New Hire event in SuccessFactors
􀍻 No self-service functions are delivered as standard for AU Employees
Enhancement Considerations
􀍻 Options open to DoE will need to be two-fold to account for the different functionality, namely:
○ Self Service functionality. This function could either be developed using an EC MDF Portlet or
through a stand-alone BTP app.
􀁸 Auto update of Onboarding Superannuation details directly into ECP. This function will require
ABAP developed on the BTP platform.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central – Self-Service MDF Portlet
At the simplest level, utilising a custom MDF portlet can allow DoE employees to update their
Superannuation details. Flexibility exists in standard configuration to control permissions at the field level
to determine what an employee sees versus what they update.

Employee Central Payroll – HR Infotype Auto Update
Alongside the MDF portlet, an ECP program would be required to read the portlet information and update
the infotype in ECP to ensure the changes are ready for the next pay run. Validations can easily be added
to ensure no retrospective changes are allowed and effective dates are from the start of a pay period.
Employee Central Payroll – Onboarding to HR Infotype Auto Update
SAP Integration Suite can manage the pass through of data from Onboarding to ECP. Upon successful
replication from EC to ECP then Superannuation Details entered via Onboarding can be saved directly to
Infotype 220 in ECP.
Impact on ER % following a change in Employee % Contribution
Following an update to an Employee % the appropriate Employer % contributions should be
checked/updated:
