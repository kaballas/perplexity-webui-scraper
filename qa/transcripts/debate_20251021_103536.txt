Round 1 - ChangeMgmt
================================================================================
Based on the comprehensive requirements for the Organisation Design functionality, here are the potential WRICEF components needed:

## **Workflows (W)**

1. **Position Creation Workflow** - Automated routing to JADE and Finance teams for review/approval based on pre-defined parameters (permanent positions, SES positions)
2. **Position Change Workflow** - Approval processes for modifications to existing positions
3. **Organisation Unit Change Workflow** - Approval processes for org structure modifications
4. **Job Creation/Change Workflow** - Management of job architecture changes
5. **Concurrent Employment Workflow** - Management of employees occupying multiple positions

## **Reports (R)**

1. **Organisation Structure Reports** - Graphical and list format displays of hierarchical structures
2. **Vacancy Management Reports** - Visibility across vacant, filled, and shared positions
3. **Occupancy Management Reports** - Tracking of position occupancy and concurrent employment
4. **Headcount and FTE Reports** - Management reporting at various organizational levels
5. **Establishment Management Reports** - Consolidated views across org units, jobs, positions, locations
6. **Organisational Chart Reports** - Online charts with historical, current, and future scenarios
7. **Resource and FTE Management Reports** - School-specific position management

## **Interfaces (I)**

1. **Centre Information System (CIS) Integration** - Required data attributes for organizational units
2. **Payroll Interface** - Automatic inclusion of position-based allowances in payroll calculations
3. **Employee Movement Interface** - Automatic occupancy management from employee movements
4. **External Mapping Interface** - ANZSCO Codes and Descriptions mapping
5. **Bulk Load Interface** - For annual school allocations and organizational changes
6. **Location Management Interface** - GIS integration for longitude/latitude details

## **Converts (C)**

Round 2 - Critique
================================================================================
# Critical Evaluation of WRICEF Component Notes

## 1. Clarity Assessment

**Strengths:**
- The categorization by WRICEF components (Workflows, Reports, Interfaces, Converts, Enhancements) is clear and well-structured
- Each component includes descriptive titles that generally indicate their purpose
- The list is comprehensive, covering the major functional areas of organizational design

**Clarity Issues:**
- Some entries lack specific technical details that would enable implementation (e.g., "Organisation Design Module Enhancement" - what specific functionality?)
- Several items reference external systems without clear integration points or data flows
- The relationship between different components is not explicitly defined

## 2. Coherence Assessment

**Coherence Issues Identified:**
- **Inconsistent Level of Detail**: Some entries are very granular (e.g., "Location-Based Allowance Enhancement") while others are overly broad (e.g., "Organisation Design Module Enhancement")
- **Missing Context**: The notes don't clearly connect to the underlying SuccessFactors foundation objects (FOCompany, FODepartment, FOPosition, etc.) mentioned in the source documentation
- **Workflow Logic Gaps**: The workflow triggers and conditions are not specified (e.g., when does a position change require JADE review vs. Finance review?)

## 3. Relevance to Source Documentation

**Relevance Issues:**
- The notes mention "JADE and Finance teams" which appears to be organization-specific and not referenced in the source documents
- Missing reference to the **OrganizationReportingCube** and **VacancyManagementReport** objects detailed in the metadata
- No mention of the **OData Integration Service** endpoints that are specifically required for CIS integration
- The **effective dating** capabilities mentioned in source documents are only partially reflected in the "Enhancements" section

## 4. Suggestions for Improvement

### Immediate Improvements:

1. **Add Technical Specificity**: Include the actual SuccessFactors object names and field mappings
   - Instead of: "Organisation Structure Reports"
   - Use: "Organizational Hierarchy Reports using FODepartment, FODivision with effective dating support"

2. **Define Integration Endpoints**: Reference the specific OData entity sets mentioned in the source
   - Include: `FODepartment`, `FOJobCode`, `FOLocation`, `Position` entity sets in Interface descriptions

3. **Specify Validation Rules**: Add the business rules mentioned in source documents
   - Include: "Position FTE ≤ Org Unit FTE Cap" validation logic

4. **Clarify Workflow Triggers**: Define specific conditions for workflow initiation
   - Instead of: "Position Change Workflow"
   - Use: "Position FTE Change Workflow (triggers when FTE > 1.0 or FTE cap exceeded)"

### Structural Improvements:

5. **Add Dependencies**: Show relationships between components
   - Example: "Reports depend on Interfaces for data, Workflows trigger Convert processes"

6. **Include Data Flow Information**: Specify what data moves between components
   - Example: "CIS Integration feeds Location data to Position management"

7. **Reference Specific Requirements**: Link each component to the functional requirements (FR-1, FR-27, FR-38, etc.) mentioned in source documents

### Quality Enhancements:

8. **Add Success Criteria**: Define how each component will be measured for success
9. **Include Error Handling**: Specify how failures will be managed in each component
10. **Define User Roles**: Clarify which roles interact with each component

## 5. Overall Assessment

The notes provide a solid foundation for the WRICEF components but require significant technical detail and structural refinement to serve as an implementation guide. The connection to the source documentation's technical specifications needs strengthening, particularly around the SuccessFactors foundation objects, OData endpoints, and specific validation rules that were clearly outlined in the metadata.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Map all components to specific SuccessFactors objects and fields
2. Define clear integration specifications with CIS
3. Include the effective dating and temporal management requirements
4. Add specific business validation rules and workflow conditions
