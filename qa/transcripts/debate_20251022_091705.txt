TASK: hcms_technical_overview:
  executive_summary: |
    The Department of Education (DoE) is transforming its HR and payroll systems under the HCMS Program...
    Key pillars:
      - SAP HXM suite (SuccessFactors, BTP, Integration Suite, Data Sphere, ALM)
      - Microsoft Fabric-based HR Resource Group (HR RG)
    HR RG acts as the golden record, MDM layer, and authoritative data source for EDP integration.
    The system follows a unified DevOps and IS18:2018/QGEA-aligned security framework.
    The program has two phases: foundation and enablement (Oct 2025–Mar 2026).

FR-17	Essential	The solution must provide warnings when a request is submitted to create a new position would result in the approved FTE cap for that organisational unit to be exceeded.	Shippy - not standard, the standard can put warnings on the position. The foundation workbook doesn't appear to have a field showing the FTE of an org unit either. 	"Enhancement - could extend or modify our custom position control functionality to include Org unit level FTE control
TV : Enhancement (E). It involves extending the core success factors to incorporate organizational FTE validation during position creation, which the standard system does not natively support."
FR-18	Essential	The solution must support the changing of positions with a date effective with the option to change / update any of the data attributes stored against the position.	Shippy - Position workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement	TV:Enhancement (E) - Position and Organisation Management Business Logic , Custom MDF objects and business rules development to handle complex concurrent employment scenarios, position-based allowance calculations, and automatic attribute inheritance with employee-level override capabilities.

FR-23	Essential	The solution must allow line managers to create and edit positions based on allowable permissions (e.g. schools to create self-funded positions), which automatically updates the schools establishment without the need for additional workflow approvals.	Shippy - Foundation workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement. This is controlled via RBPs
FR-24	Essential	The solution must support Headcount and FTE management for Corporate positions at both a position level and positions within an organisational unit.	Shippy - More detail required here as to what the expectation is.
FR-25	Essential	The solution must support Resource and FTE management for School positions at both a position level and positions within an organisational unit.	SAP will say this is standard however the standard functionality is limited. A custom solution will be required for this.	Big Rock
FR-26	Essential	The solution must support a maximum allowed allocation of FTE against positions at multiple levels of the org structure (e.g. unit, branch or division).	Need to understand what this means. Relates to FR-17. The position itself will have a single maximum allocation. 	"Enhancement
TV : "
FR-27	Essential	The solution must support vacancy management, including vacancy management reporting, across 1:1 position management, 1:Many position management and a hybrid model of both 1:1 and 1:Many establishment management model.	Shippy - Position workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement

Shippy - Position workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement
FR-29	Essential	The solution must support the creation and ongoing management of positions for volunteers, contingent / contractor employees and casuals in a talent pool via 1:Many position management.	Shippy - Position workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement
FR-30	Essential	The solution must support automatic occupancy management from employee movements including concurrent employment.	Shippy - Position workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement
FR-31	Essential	The solution must allow an employee to occupy multiple positions numbers concurrently and accurately reflect the occupied concurrent positions against the Department’s establishment management and organisational structure.	Is this just CE or also Multiple Positions. I.e. will each position be dealt with as a separate employment or will they form a single employment.	Possible
FR-32	Essential	The solution must support position based allowances that are automatically included in payroll calculations for any employee assigned to that position.	"Non-standard. Allowances are Award based not positiion based. Would require clarification of requirement.
Shippy - in the workbooks it mentions a location/allowance based table which wouldstill not be standard but would be controllable via business rules and look ups rather than allowances on the position which would need complex CPI work. Note as well, the position work book  does not have allowances mentioned. "	Possible enhancement, however detail required as may be standard
FR-33	Essential	The solution must support the automatic inheriting of data attributes stored against positions through to the creation of new hires, with the option to override at the employee level.	Shippy - Position workbook/standard functionality meets this requirement
FR-34	Essential	The solution must support the creation of locations / centres with a date effective and a range of data attributes e.g. Location ID, Location Name, Location Address, Location Contact Details and Longitude and Latitude details.

FR-37	Essential	The solution must support the recording of an employee’s work site location and their physical location e.g. work site location is a remote location and their physical location for certain days of the week is a personal residence or virtual academy, which has pay outcome implications e.g. no entitlement location based allowances if working from a personal residence that is outside of the remote location.	"Location based allowances, how would we handle recording the location of the person per day in order to identify whether the allowances are paid or not
Shippy - There is no field defined in the employee data workbook, which I believe is an omission as it would be to be on there to enable any logic for payments, or this could be claimed through timesheets? "	TV: Enhancement (E) - Location-Based Pay and Allowance,Custom enhancement to manage work site vs. physical location validation, remote work allowance calculations, and geographic coordinate integration for school-based establishment management.
FR-38	Essential	The solution must support organisation design reporting including vacancy management reporting, occupancy management reporting, headcount and FTE reporting, organisational structure reporting and establishment management reporting with a consolidated view across organisational units, jobs, positions, locations, concurrent employment and key employee information.	Shippy - standard functionality/reporting meets this requirement
