Topic: Configuration Workbooks
Table 1 – Configuration Workbooks
The following configuration workbooks will apply for Queensland Department of Education:
Workbook Topics covered
Foundation Data The workbook is used to capture essential information about the organisation's structure,
including:
􀍻 Corporate Structure: Company codes, business units, divisions, and
departments.
􀍻 Pay Structure: Pay grades, pay ranges, and compensation data.
􀍻 Job Structure: Job classifications, job codes, and position details.
􀍻 Geographical Structure: Locations, countries, and regions where the company
operates.
EC Position
Management
The workbook is designed to collect detailed information about an organisation's
position hierarchy and management rules, including:
􀍻 Position Hierarchy: Reporting structures, parent-child relationships between
positions, and organisational charts.
􀍻 Position Details: Position titles, job codes, headcount limits, and effective
dating for positions.
􀍻 Position Attributes: Status (active/inactive), position type (regular, temporary),
and criticality.
The workbook also details rules and validations related to Position Management, such
as:
􀍻 Position Creation and Approval: Workflows for creating and approving new
positions.
􀍻 Position Changes: Rules for position transfers, promotions, and demotions.
􀍻 Position Inheritance: Logic for inheriting attributes (e.g., department, location)
from parent positions.

### Section Hierarchy
- **Level 1**: Configuration Workbooks Overview
- **Level 2**: Foundation Data Workbook
- **Level 3**: EC Position Management Workbook
- **Level 4**: Detailed configuration requirements and rules

## 2. Key Entities, Systems, and Components

### Core Systems
- **SAP SuccessFactors** (Employee Central platform)
- **Human Capital Management System (HCMS)**

### Primary Workbooks
- **Foundation Data Workbook**
- **EC Position Management Workbook**

### Organizational Components
- **Corporate Structure**: Company codes, business units, divisions, departments
- **Pay Structure**: Pay grades, pay ranges, compensation data
- **Job Structure**: Job classifications, job codes, position details

## 3. Relationships and Dependencies

### Configuration Dependencies
- **Foundation Data** → **EC Position Management** (prerequisite relationship)
- Corporate structure data feeds into position hierarchy configuration
- Job structure defines position types and classifications
- Geographical structure provides location context for positions

### System Dependencies
- **Design Authority (DA)** approval required for:
  - Configuration activities impacting other operational areas
  - Custom development (non-configuration) activities
  - Integration and data considerations

### Governance Dependencies
- **PCG (Programme Control Group)** escalation after DA endorsement
- **Board** approval for significant configuration impacts

## 4. Technical Flows and Integrations

### Configuration Flow Process
```
Configuration Activity → DA Endorsement → PCG Review → Board Approval (if required)
```

### Data Flow Hierarchy
1. **Foundation Data Input** → **Organizational Structure Creation**
2. **Job Structure Input** → **Position Definition**
3. **Geographical Structure Input** → **Location-Based Position Assignment**
4. **Position Management Rules** → **Workflow Configuration**

### Integration Considerations
- Technical approvals for integration and data components
- Consistent UX approach across all decision-making processes
- Impact assessment for operational areas

## 5. Validation and Traceability

### Validation Requirements
- **Design Authority Endorsement**: Required for cross-operational impact
- **Technical Approval Process**: For integration and data components
- **UX Consistency**: Ensured across all decision-making activities

### Traceability Elements
- **Document Metadata**: Version control and publication tracking
- **Configuration Workbooks**: Detailed requirement capture and tracking
- **Approval Workflow**: Clear escalation path from DA to Board

## 6. Structured Summary with Headings and Bullet Hierarchy

### Configuration Workbooks Overview
- **Queensland Department of Education** implementation
- **Two primary workbooks** for comprehensive organizational setup
- **Governance framework** with Design Authority oversight

### Foundation Data Workbook
