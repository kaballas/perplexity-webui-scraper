Topic: The solution must support the processing of date effective internal secondments, including the end date for the internal secondment, with the required employment details automatically defaulting from the internal secondment position which can be overridden by HR and Payroll officers during the processing of the internal secondment.
Automatically Creating End Actions for temporary actions (such as Temporary Assignments, Secondment, etc.)	Medium	33		Many mobility actions within the Australian Public Sector (e.g. Secondment, temporary assignment, Fixed Term hires, Higher Duties) require an end action to be created as soon as the start action is created to identify the person returning to their substantive position at the end of the period. Standard SAP only suppports a subset of these actions creating the end action automatically.

***

## Configuration Options

### Provisioning Enablement

**Location**: Provisioning > Company Settings

**Enable Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment** in the Industry Features section. This is the prerequisite configuration that activates the feature globally for the instance.

**Prerequisites**: SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central and Employee Central Position Management must be enabled with Position configured as the leading system for hierarchies.

***

### Admin Center Configuration Settings

**Navigation**: Admin Center > Manage Data > Create New > Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment Configuration

#### Core Settings

**Allow Automatic Termination through the Terminate Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment job**: Flag determining whether assignments can be terminated automatically via scheduled job execution when end dates are reached.

**Base Pay Component Group**: Defines pay components considered as base pay only, used when allowance basis calculation is "Base pay only". Each pay component requires corresponding wage type mapping in Employee Central Payroll IT0008.

**Annualized Pay Component Group**: Contains pay components including both base pay and allowances, applicable when allowance basis is "Base Pay and Allowances".

**Applicable Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment Pay Component Group**: Subset of pay components to include/exclude from higher duty allowance calculations, allowing control over which components from base/annualized groups are considered. Example: excluding car allowance from HD computation even if part of annualized salary.

**Estimated Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment Allowance Pay Component**: Recurring pay component (annual frequency) to display estimated higher duty allowance in Compensation Information, applicable only for standard HD allowance computation.

**Event Reason for Comp Info Updates**: Event reason code used when the system automatically creates the Estimated Higher Duty Allowance recurring pay component during HD allowance calculation.

**Allow Permission to Add Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment**: Bypass flag controlling whether users can add/end assignments without standard employment permissions. Default is "No".

- **Yes**: Users can create HD/TA with only HD-specific permissions, outside target population
- **No**: Users require standard employment permissions in addition to HD permissions

***

### Role-Based Permissions

**Navigation**: Admin Center > Manage Permission Roles > [Target Role] > Permission Settings

**Permission Category**: Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment

**Required Permissions**:
- Add Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment
- End Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment
- View Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment details

**Bypass Permission Flag Integration**: Works in conjunction with the "Allow Permission" setting in configuration to control whether standard employment permissions are required.

***

### Workflow Configuration

**Navigation**: Admin Center > Configure Workflows > Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment HRIS Actions

**Event Reasons Configuration**: Update picklist for Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment events in the Corporate Data Model. Ensure picklist ID matches the HRIS field `<event>` of HRIS element `<eventReason>` without changing external codes.

**Workflow Support**: Configure approval workflows for HD/TA start and end actions, supporting multi-level approvals and routing based on organizational hierarchy.

***

### Automatic Termination Configuration

**Navigation**: Admin Center > Manage Higher Duty or Temporary Assignment > Automatic Termination Settings

**Settings**:
- Enable/disable automatic end dating
- Define termination job schedule frequency
- Configure end date mandatory/optional rules
- Set notification triggers for approaching end dates

***

### Right to Return Configuration

**Eligibility Requirements**: Right to Return applies only to assignments with **100% Full Responsibility** for the temporary position.

**Configuration**: Automatic return to substantive position upon end dating of the temporary assignment. Employment details from original position are restored.

***

### Business Rules Configuration

**Position-Based Defaulting**: Configure Business Rules to automatically populate employment details from the target position:

- Organizational Unit
- Job Code
- Pay Grade
- Cost Center
- Work Location
- Manager

**Validation Rules**: Configure mandatory field validation for temporary assignment start/end dates, position assignments, and responsibility percentages.

***

### Data Model Configuration

**Corporate Data Model**: Configure the `<eventReason>` HRIS element for Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment event types.

**Concurrent Employment**: HD/TA creates concurrent employment records requiring data model support for multiple active employment relationships.

**Effective Dating**: Ensure effective dating is enabled for all relevant infotypes to support date-effective processing of secondment changes.

***

### Integration Configuration

**Employee Central Payroll Replication**: Configure replication of HD/TA data to ECP for payroll processing of higher duty allowances. Wage type mappings must align between EC pay components and ECP IT0008.

**Check Tool**: Use the Higher Duty/Temporary Assignment Check Tool to validate configuration completeness and identify missing settings.
