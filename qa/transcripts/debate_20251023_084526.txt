1	Introduction
1.1	Overview
Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the current DoE system a claims portal is utilised for school based casual work for non-teaching positions.  Via a user interface the business manager can enter time and claims for casual non-teacher employees and casual teachers (where not using class cover).

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
By contrast, the standard behavior in SuccessFactors Time Off is to allow individuals to use timesheeting to makes claims.  But there is no school level basis for entering claims and due to the specific location and award interpretations required by DoE the standard functionality does not meet requirements.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation. This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

1.2	Assumptions
To maintain flexibility, the specification is designed to be language-agnostic, supporting various frameworks available on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).  The Department of Education (DoE) should collaborate with their Service Integrator to select the most suitable framework.  For optimal integration and user experience, we recommend adopting the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with an SAPUI5/Fiori-based user interface.
The Teacher ID in Class Cover is the assignment ID from SuccessFactors for the Casual employment.
Standard Payroll Processing can be used to determine payment amounts and other payments using standard configuration and data provided in the IT2010 record.

1.3	Dependencies
That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.

2	System Design
2.1	High Level Design
Overview
The Casual Timesheet Extension (CTE) is a Business Technology Platform (BTP) application accessible from the SuccessFactors homepage for Business Development Managers (BDMs). The application streamlines timesheet management, claim submission, and payroll integration.
Data Retrieval
•	The CTE application retrieves school and employee data from SuccessFactors using OData API calls.
•	Payment type and costing configurations are stored in BTP tables, determining source and override functions for cost centers and classifications.
Claim Submission
•	Claims are saved in the CTE Header and Item tables within BTP.
•	BDMs can submit claims for payment after entering the required data.
•	The claim moves to the approver, the CTE approver table triggers an email notification to the designated approver (The manager can be found from SF via OData negating the table requirement).
•	Approvers can access the application to review, edit and approve the claim. (Note: Approver cannot approve an entry against themselves – this would require approval 1 up of the approver.)
Payroll Integration
•	CTE claim items are replicated to SuccessFactors ECP Payroll via BTP integration.
o	The integration uses the BAPI BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST to pass:Assignment ID,ECP wage ype,Date,Hours/number,Unit,Classification (pay scale group and level),Cost assignment details (cost center, school, location)
•	A logical system number and reference document link the CTE Item to the IT2010 entry in SuccessFactors.
•	Successful integration returns a reference number; failures return an error message, which is recorded in the CTE claim item.
Error Handling and Reprocessing
•	Claims with errors are displayed in the CTE application for payroll administrators.
•	Administrators can view and reprocess erroneous items.
•	The BAPI uses a staging table (PTEX) before loading data into IT2010.
•	The integration runs the program RPTEXTPT in ECP to insert records into IT2010.
•	Errors are logged in the integration log, and payroll administrators can monitor the PTEX staging area for issues.

2.3	BTP Application UI Design
The UI layer should be built using SAPUI5 for SuccessFactors compatibility.
The frontend features should be:
•	Area at the top of the page to select the school via an OData API call to Successfactors and a drop down on the Weeks Starting
•	Then a table is presented with the detailed fields and actions on it
•	Confirmation and error message area.
Detailed UI Elements
Element	Description	Location
School	Select the School for the claims to be against	Above table
Week Starting 	Dropdown with start dates of the last 52 Weeks	Above table
Search Button	Button to filter table entries	Above table
Table Columns	Favorite, Employee Number, Payment Type, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Total, Employee Replaced, Overrides, Status, Action	Main table

2.4	BTP Application Actions
The buttons on the CTE application and the action taken
Button	Action Description	View/Notes
Save	Checks and saves the CTE claim as draft status in the BTP tables
Submit	Sends the CTE claim details for approval
Approve	Approves the CTE claim and submits it to ECP for 	For Approvers
Delete	Delete the CTE claim item	If the claim has already been replicated to ECP deletion this is not possible.  Make the button inactive when this is the case
Resend	Resends the CTE claim item via the BTP Integration to ECP.	Only available to payroll admins when an item is in Error
Overrides	Allows classification and cost center to be displayed and override entries if allowed via config.  This is via a pop up screen on the app.	The screen shows the default cost center (from employee position or costing table) and default classification from the config table.  If override is allowed for either field then an extra field for input is shown.  Cost Center from EC OData API and Classification from config.
Employee Replace	Allow entry of the employee assignment that is being replaced.  This would be employee assignments restricted by the school selected.	This can be different for each day.  Pop shows Mon – Fri for employee.
Fav	Ability to set a line as a favorite.  This creates an entry in the BTP table pointing to the item as a favorite.  	When the user selects a school any favorites saved for that school should be displayed for a new claim week. (or via popup before displaying….)
Note: There are a number of business rules around how to find the correct classification for payment types that are loaded against an assignment that need to be determined.  This could be position based, payment type, previous payments for the assignment etc.  This needs to be determined for the build task.
No future dated claims are allowed to be submitted for approval (TBC).

2.5	BTP Integration
Overview
This integration leverages SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) to replicate CTE (Claim Time and Expense) claim items or Class Cover file data into SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll (ECP).  The core mechanism involves calling the BAPI BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST to stage data, followed by executing the program RPTEXTPT to load the data into Infotype 2010 (IT2010).
The integration handles data mapping, success/failure responses, linking via an external number, and error logging/updating in the CTE system. It supports reprocessing of failed items by payroll administrators through a dedicated view in the CTE application.
Key objectives:
•	Automate replication of claim items for payroll processing.
•	Ensure traceability between CTE items and ECP IT2010 entries.
•	Provide robust error handling and visibility for administrators.
Components Involved
•	Source System: CTE application (holds claim items) or Class Cover.
•	Integration Platform: SAP BTP (orchestrates the flow, e.g., via Cloud Integration or custom services).
•	Target System: SuccessFactors ECP Payroll (uses BAPI for staging and program for loading).
•	Key SAP Objects:
o	BAPI: BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST (for inserting data into a staging table).
o	Program: RPTEXTPT (run in ECP to process staged data into IT2010).
o	Infotype: IT2010 (final destination for remuneration specifications).
•	Data Elements Passed:
Field	Description	Source
Assignment ID	Unique identifier for the employee assignment.	CTE Claim Item
ECP Wage Type	Payroll wage type code.	CTE Claim Item
Date	Effective date of the claim.	CTE Claim Item
Hours/Number	Quantity (e.g., hours worked).	CTE Claim Item
Unit	Unit of measure (e.g., hours, days).	CTE Claim Item
Classification	Pay scale group and level.	CTE Claim Item
Cost Assignment	Cost center, school, and location details.	CTE Claim Item
Ref Doc	Generated linking number (for CTE-IT2010 traceability).	Generated/Returned by Integration
Logical System	Ext System – Separate CTE and ClassCover	BTP Constant
Integration Flow (High-Level Steps)
1.	Trigger: The integration is initiated when a CTE claim item is submitted for replication (e.g., via API call).  Or when Class Cover file is received and uploaded into BTP.
2.	Data Extraction and Mapping:
o	Extract claim item data from CTE or Class Cover file.
o	Map fields to BAPI input parameters (e.g., assignment ID to employee/pernr, wage type, date, etc.).
o	Generate a reference number for linking.
o	Set the Logical system dependent on whether this is called by CTE or Class Cover.
3.	BAPI Call:
o	Invoke BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST via BTP (e.g., using RFC or OData adapter).
o	Pass mapped data to insert into the ECP staging table.
o	Handle BAPI response: If successful, hold the reference number; if failed, capture error message.
4.	Data Loading:
o	If BAPI succeeds, trigger the program RPTEXTPT in ECP (e.g., via RFC).
o	This processes the staged data into IT2010.
5.	Response Handling:
o	On success: Return the reference document to CTE and update the claim item record.  For class cover log the success against with the reference document.
o	On failure (at BAPI or program stage): Return error message to CTE, update the claim item, and log the error in the integration log (e.g., BTP monitoring logs).
6.	Error Visibility and Reprocessing:
o	Failed items appear in a dedicated view within the CTE application.
o	Payroll administrators can review errors and manually reprocess items (triggering the integration again).
Error Handling
•	Types of Errors:
o	Validation errors (e.g., invalid wage type).
o	BAPI failures (e.g., staging table insertion issues).
o	Program execution errors (e.g., data not loaded into IT2010).
•	Logging: All errors are captured in BTP integration logs for auditing and debugging.
•	Recovery: CTE updates ensure errors are visible; reprocessing allows admins to retry without data loss.
•	Notifications: Optionally, configure BTP to send alerts (e.g., via email or integration with monitoring tools) for persistent failures.
•	Assumptions and Considerations
•	Authentication: Use secure connections (e.g., OAuth or certificates) between BTP and ECP.
•	Performance: Batch processing for multiple claim items to optimize BAPI calls.
•	Monitoring: Leverage BTP's integration monitoring for real-time status and logs.
•	Testing: Validate end-to-end flow, including edge cases like partial successes or network failures.

Explain the Dependencies That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.
================================================================================

================================================================================
Task 1
================================================================================
Based on the provided specification document (SPECIFICATION E027 – Casual Timesheet Extension) and the related context documents, here's an explanation of the dependency "That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP":

1.  **Integration Scope:** The BTP integration described in section 2.5 is designed to handle *two* potential data sources for payroll processing:
    *   Claims entered via the new **Casual Timesheet Extension (CTE)** application (built to replace the existing Claims Portal).
    *   Data originating from the **Class Cover** system.

2.  **Stated Purpose:** Section 1.1 mentions that the integration is required to "send this information [from the CTE] to ECP payroll". Crucially, section 2.5 (BTP Integration Overview) explicitly states: "This same integration is also required to ingest the **class cover integration when it becomes operation**." This sentence directly links the BTP integration's functionality to Class Cover becoming operational.

3.  **Integration Flow:** Section 2.5 details the integration flow. Step 1 ("Trigger") specifies: "The integration is initiated when a CTE claim item is submitted for replication (e.g., via API call). **Or when Class Cover file is received and uploaded into BTP.**" This clearly indicates that the BTP integration component must be ready to receive and process data from Class Cover once Class Cover is live and feeding data into the BTP environment.

4.  **Dependency Reasoning:** The dependency exists because:
    *   The BTP application and its CTE component are being built primarily to replace the *current* Claims Portal for non-Class Cover casual work.
    *   However, the *integration* component within BTP (the mechanism to send data to ECP Payroll via the specific BAPI/Program) is designed to be a *shared* service for *both* the new CTE and the *future* Class Cover data stream.
    *   While the CTE application can potentially be developed and tested independently of Class Cover, the full scope of the BTP *integration* cannot be completely finalized, tested, and considered fully operational until the Class Cover system is itself operational and able to send its data to the BTP integration endpoint.

Therefore, the dependency means that the *complete implementation and testing* of the BTP integration component (which handles data flow to ECP Payroll) is contingent upon the Class Cover system being up and running and ready to interface with the BTP platform. The BTP integration must be prepared to handle Class Cover data when that system goes live.
