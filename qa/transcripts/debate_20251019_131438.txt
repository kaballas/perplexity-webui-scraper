- Document assumptions with risk levels and validation requirements

**CONTEXT INTEGRATION**:
- Standard SAP behavior: FTE control exists only at position level via position Controlled attribute
- Current requirement: Real-time validation and monitoring of FTE totals across organizational units
- Proposed solution: Custom WRICEF Enhancement using PeopleForms and Azure DataHub integration with SAP BTP
- Queensland DoE governance and compliance requirements apply

**OUTPUT SPECIFICATION**:
Format as structured list with:
- Assumption ID and category
- Assumption description
- Risk level (High/Medium/Low)
- Validation approach required
- Impact if assumption proves invalid

**ASSUMPTION CATEGORIES**:
- Technical: Integration capabilities, performance, scalability
- Business: User requirements, organizational structure, compliance
- Integration: Azure DataHub connectivity, BTP services availability
- Governance: Change management, training, adoption

**VALIDATION CRITERIA**: Each assumption must include specific validation method and potential mitigation if proven incorrect.

Round 2 - AnswerQuestions
================================================================================
Based on my analysis of the Queensland Department of Education's HCMS implementation requirements and the proposed FTE control enhancement, I'll provide a comprehensive breakdown of the key implementation assumptions:

## **IMPLEMENTATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR FTE CONTROL ENHANCEMENT**

### **TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS**

**TA-001: Azure DataHub Integration Capability**
- **Description**: Azure DataHub can effectively serve as the central repository for real-time FTE calculations and organizational unit aggregations
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Validation Approach**: Conduct POC with Azure DataHub API connectivity and real-time data synchronization testing
- **Impact if Invalid**: Would require alternative data storage architecture, potentially increasing complexity and cost

**TA-002: SAP BTP Workflow Performance**
- **Description**: SAP BTP Workflow service can handle real-time FTE validation without impacting system performance during position creation/modification
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Validation Approach**: Load testing with concurrent position management operations
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could result in system performance degradation and user experience issues

**TA-003: PeopleForms Custom Field Integration**
- **Description**: PeopleForms can successfully integrate with custom validation logic and provide real-time feedback to users during position creation
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Validation Approach**: Technical spike to validate PeopleForms API capabilities with external data sources
- **Impact if Invalid**: Would require alternative UI/UX approach, potentially impacting user adoption

### **BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS**

**BA-001: Organizational Unit Structure Stability**
- **Description**: The organizational unit hierarchy structure will remain relatively stable during the implementation period
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Validation Approach**: Review current org structure change frequency and validate with business stakeholders
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could require dynamic validation logic adjustments and increased maintenance overhead

**BA-002: FTE Calculation Methodology Consensus**
- **Description**: Queensland DoE stakeholders have agreed on FTE calculation rules and organizational unit boundaries
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Validation Approach**: Conduct requirements validation workshop with key business users
- **Impact if Invalid**: Would require re-architecture of validation logic and potential rework of integration components

**BA-003: User Acceptance of Real-time Validation**
- **Description**: HR users will accept and adapt to real-time FTE cap validation during position management processes
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Validation Approach**: User acceptance testing and change management assessment
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could impact user adoption and system effectiveness

### **INTEGRATION ASSUMPTIONS**

**IA-001: SAP SuccessFactors to Azure Connectivity**
- **Description**: Reliable, low-latency connectivity exists between SAP SuccessFactors and Azure DataHub for real-time validation
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Validation Approach**: Network connectivity testing and SLA validation
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could result in validation failures and inconsistent FTE management

**IA-002: Data Synchronization Consistency**
- **Description**: Data synchronization between SuccessFactors and Azure DataHub maintains consistency during concurrent operations
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Validation Approach**: Concurrent user testing and data integrity validation
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could result in FTE calculation errors and compliance issues

**IA-003: CPI/IC Integration Suite Availability**
- **Description**: SAP Integration Suite (CPI/IC) can handle the required data transformation and routing for FTE validation
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Validation Approach**: Integration flow testing with peak load scenarios
- **Impact if Invalid**: Would require alternative integration approach and potential infrastructure changes

### **GOVERNANCE ASSUMPTIONS**

**GA-001: Change Management Readiness**
- **Description**: Queensland DoE has adequate change management resources and organizational readiness for the FTE control enhancement
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Validation Approach**: Change readiness assessment and stakeholder engagement validation
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could result in delayed adoption and reduced system effectiveness

**GA-002: Training Resource Availability**
- **Description**: Sufficient training resources and time are available for HR users to adapt to the new FTE validation process
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Validation Approach**: Training resource planning and user group assessment
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could impact user adoption and system utilization

**GA-003: Compliance Alignment**
- **Description**: The custom FTE validation solution aligns with Queensland Government IS18:2018 and QGEA requirements
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Validation Approach**: Security and compliance review with governance stakeholders
- **Impact if Invalid**: Could result in non-compliance and potential system audit failures

## **VALIDATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Immediate Validation**: Conduct technical POC for Azure DataHub integration and PeopleForms connectivity
2. **Requirements Validation**: Facilitate stakeholder workshops to confirm FTE calculation methodologies
3. **Performance Testing**: Execute load testing scenarios for real-time validation performance
4. **Compliance Review**: Validate solution design against Queensland Government security frameworks

These assumptions form the foundation for successful implementation of the FTE control enhancement and require systematic validation to ensure project success.
