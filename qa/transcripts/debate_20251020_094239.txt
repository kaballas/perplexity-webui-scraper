Round 1 - Writer
================================================================================
The HCMS Technical Overview details the Department of Education's new platform, built on two core components: the SAP platform and the Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG).

### SAP Platform
- **SAP SuccessFactors**: Core HR functions, including Employee Central, Payroll, Recruitment, and Onboarding.
- **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)**: Enables API-based communication, identity federation, and extensibility for SAP modules.
- **SAP Integration Suite**: Facilitates data exchange between SAP components and external platforms like Microsoft Fabric.
- **SAP Data Sphere**: Harmonizes HR and payroll data from SAP sources, preparing it for the HR RG.
- **SAP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management)**: Oversees testing, change control, and release documentation for SAP components.
- **SAP Build Apps**: Supports low-code development of custom HR workflow extensions.
- **OpenText Extended ECM for SAP SuccessFactors**: Manages document generation and storage for employment records.
- **OpenText InfoArchive**: Planned for long-term archiving of historical HR and payroll documents from retired systems.
- **Joule**: Provides AI-driven analytics and insights within the HR interface.
- **Signavio**: Assists with process analysis.
- **SAP WalkMe**: Enhances user experience with guided onboarding and digital adoption tools.

### Microsoft Azure Technologies
- **Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG)**: Central data repository serving as the master data management (MDM) layer and "golden record" for HR and payroll data.
- **Medallion Architecture**: Organizes the HR RG into bronze, silver, and gold layers for data ingestion, staging, and business-ready datasets.
- **Azure DataHub**: Manages data ingestion into the HR RG.
- **Dataflows and Notebooks**: Perform data transformation within Fabric.
- **Terraform and Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate and provision HR RG infrastructure.
- **Microsoft Purview**: Handles data classification, lineage, and metadata.
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Planned as the monitoring solution for audit trails and alerts, replacing Splunk.
- **Power BI Gateway (On-Prem Gateway)**: Supported legacy data ingestion during the proof-of-concept phase.

### Downstream Systems
The HCMS integrates with downstream systems sourcing HR data from the HR RG, including:
- CIS
- IAM
- Alloc8
- SBS
- OneSchool

### Data Flow and Integration

#### 1. Transformation Logic: SAP Data Sphere vs. Microsoft Fabric
- **SAP Data Sphere**: Focuses on SAP-specific data harmonization and modeling for HR and payroll, delivering business-ready data to the HR RG.
- **Microsoft Fabric Dataflows**: Handles general-purpose data transformation, including cleansing, staging, and enrichment, following the Medallion Architecture. Processes data from SAP and other enterprise sources.
- **Usage**: SAP Data Sphere is used for SAP-specific transformations, while Fabric handles broader data processing and integration.

#### 2. Data Synchronization Failure
- **SAP Integration Suite**: Monitors and logs data exchange between SAP and Fabric.
- **Azure DevOps/Terraform**: Automates ingestion jobs and flags failures for resolution.
- **Recovery and Reconciliation**:
  - **Alerting**: Splunk (and later Microsoft Sentinel) triggers alerts for failures.
  - **Monitoring**: Dashboards track integration flow status and discrepancies.
  - **Troubleshooting**: Logs identify issues such as network errors, API limits, or data format problems.
  - **Re-execution**: Failed data batches are reprocessed based on the issue type.
  - **Reconciliation**: Automated or manual processes compare SuccessFactors data with the HR RG to ensure accuracy, especially for critical data like payroll.

#### 3. Real-Time vs. Batch Data Updates
- **Batch Updates**: Used for large, less time-sensitive data (e.g., end-of-month payroll entries).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Applied to critical events (e.g., hires, terminations) using APIs or change data capture (CDC) mechanisms for near-real-time ingestion.

---

### Governance and Compliance

#### 1. Data Lineage and Audit Trails
- **Microsoft Purview**: Tracks data lineage, classification, and metadata within Fabric.
- **SAP ALM and Integration Suite Logs**: Provide audit trails for data changes within SAP.
- **End-to-End Traceability**: Combines SAP logs and Purview lineage tracking for full auditability from source to final dataset.

#### 2. Queensland Government Compliance Requirements
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines SAP capabilities with Azure scalability, aligning with Queensland Government Enterprise Architecture (QGEA) standards, including IS18:2018 for data security and interoperability.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Ensures sensitive HR data remains within Australian Azure regions, meeting local requirements.
- **Vendor Choice**: Avoids vendor lock-in by leveraging best-of-breed services.

#### 3. Microsoft Purview Across SAP-to-Fabric Boundary
- **Purview's Role**: Tracks data lineage within Fabric.
- **Cross-Boundary Lineage**: Relies on integration pipeline configurations to document SAP as the data source.

---

### Operational and Performance

#### 1. Data Latency Requirements
- **Monitoring**: SAP Integration Suite and Azure Monitor detect latency issues.
- **Latency Tolerance**: Near-real-time updates (e.g., sub-5 minutes) for critical events; batch transfers for less time-sensitive data.

#### 2. Peak Load Handling
- **SAP Scalability**: SuccessFactors supports high-volume workloads like payroll processing.
- **Azure Elasticity**: Fabric and DataHub dynamically scale resources during peak loads, such as data migration or payroll cycles.
- **Parallel Payroll Run Testing (PPRT)**: Validates system performance under peak conditions.

#### 3. Failover Strategy
- **SAP Platform**: Provides high availability and disaster recovery across multiple regions.
- **Azure Components**: Designed for high availability with geo-redundancy and Azure Site Recovery.
- **Hybrid Failover**: Coordinates failover plans for SAP and Azure components.

---

### Future State

#### 1. OpenText InfoArchive Activation
- **Triggers**: Activated for archiving historical data from the decommissioned TSS platform.
- **Migration Strategy**: Extracts data from TSS and ingests it into InfoArchive using tools like OpenText Migrate.

#### 2. SAP WalkMe and Microsoft Fabric Integration
- **WalkMe's Role**: Enhances user experience within SAP applications.
- **Integration**: WalkMe does not directly integrate with Fabric. Reporting and analytics are delivered via Power BI, while WalkMe guides users through SAP interfaces.
