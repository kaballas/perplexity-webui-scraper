TASK: Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the current DoE system a claims portal is utilised for school based casual work for non-teaching positions.  Via a user interface the business manager can enter time and claims for casual non-teacher employees and casual teachers (where not using class cover).

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
By contrast, the standard behavior in SuccessFactors Time Off is to allow individuals to use timesheeting to makes claims.  But there is no school level basis for entering claims and due to the specific location and award interpretations required by DoE the standard functionality does not meet requirements.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation. This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

Explain the Dependencies That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.

Task 1
================================================================================
Based on the provided context, I need to clarify the dependency relationship described in the documents.

## Actual Dependency Relationship

The documents indicate that **the BTP integration is required regardless of whether Class Cover is operational**. The dependency flows in the opposite direction from what the question suggests:

### Primary Requirements Independent of Class Cover:
- The BTP application is required to **replace the current Claims Portal** for school-based casual work
- This covers non-teaching positions and casual teachers **where not using Class Cover**
- The integration must send information to ECP payroll for interpretation and payment

### Integration Requirements:
The document explicitly states that the same integration is **also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operational** - this means:

1. **Phase 1**: BTP integration operates for Claims Portal replacement (non-Class Cover scenarios)
2. **Phase 2**: Same integration expands to include Class Cover functionality when available

## Correct Dependency Understanding:

The dependency is **not** that Class Cover must be operational first. Instead:
- The BTP integration **must be operational** to handle current Claims Portal replacement
- **When** Class Cover becomes operational, the existing BTP integration will need to accommodate it
- The integration design should consider award interpretation to avoid duplication between Claims Portal and Class Cover functionality

Therefore, Class Cover operational status is **not a prerequisite** for the BTP integration - rather, the BTP integration must be ready to support Class Cover when it becomes available.
