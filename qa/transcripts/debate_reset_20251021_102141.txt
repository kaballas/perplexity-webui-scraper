Original Topic: Core Hub: Employee Central
The central module serves as the single source of truth for employee information, feeding data to all connected modules for a unified workforce view.

Proposed Architecture (Blue Modules)
Talent Acquisition & Onboarding:

SAP Fieldglass → Recruiting: Job requisitions flow from contingent worker needs to full recruiting
Recruiting → Onboarding: Seamless hire process with immediate employee view
Onboarding → People and Transaction → Employee Central
Workforce Planning:

Position Management: Manages job classifications and organizational positions
Organization Management: Provides intelligent services for competence ratings by job/position
Time Management: Exchanges time off and attendance with Employee Central
Compensation & Performance:

Succession (purple): Reviews positions for successors, highlights critical roles
Compensation Review (purple): Exchanges salary info for reviews
Variable Pay (purple): Automatic bonus payout calculation
Salary Information: Feeds into compensation processes
Performance (purple): Tracks competence ratings and performance data
Analytics & Reporting:

Work Zone: Auto-assigns employees to collaborative offers, combines master/talent data
Analytics (purple): Runs analytics with accurate data, tracks all transactions
Reporting: Generates holistic workforce reports
Payroll Integration:

Payroll: Seamless integration with recalculation capabilities from Time Management
Future End-State (Purple Modules)
The purple modules represent planned additions:

Learning: Employee development tracking linked to Employee Central
Analytics: Advanced workforce analytics
Performance Management: Comprehensive performance tracking
Succession Planning: Formal succession processes
Compensation Review & Variable Pay: Complete compensation lifecycle management
Key Integration Patterns
Bi-directional flows between Employee Central and satellite modules ensure real-time data synchronization
Process chains (e.g., Fieldglass → Recruiting → Succession) enable end-to-end talent workflows
Data consolidation in Work Zone combines master and talent data for unified workforce visibility
Automated calculations in Payroll and Variable Pay reduce manual intervention
This architecture enables seamless HR processes from requisition through retirement with Employee Central maintaining data consistency across all touchpoints.
Compressed Summary: **HCMS Technical Architecture Overview - Compressed Summary**

The Queensland Department of Education's HCMS represents a hybrid SAP/Microsoft Azure architecture replacing legacy TSS systems. Key components include SAP SuccessFactors (Employee Central, Payroll, Recruitment) as the operational foundation, with Microsoft Fabric-based HR Resource Group serving as the "golden record" master data repository. Critical integration flows move data via SAP Integration Suite to Azure DataHub following medallion architecture principles. The design addresses real-time (sub-5 min) and batch processing needs, with comprehensive governance through Microsoft Purview and SAP ALM. Key challenges include managing bi-directional SAP data flows, preventing circular dependencies, ensuring compliance with Queensland Government standards and Australian data sovereignty requirements, and establishing robust failure recovery procedures. The architecture supports downstream systems (CIS, IAM, Alloc8, SBS, OneSchool) while planning for legacy TSS retirement and OpenText InfoArchive activation for historical data archiving.
