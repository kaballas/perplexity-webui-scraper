Topic: E027 – CASUAL TIMESHEET EXTENSION
A Casual Timesheet is required to replace the Claims Portal utilised for school based casual work for nonteaching
positions. The key requirements are a user interface that will:
􀍻 Allow entry of Casuals with multiple assignments to enter time in a single timesheet
􀍻 Process School Based claims
􀍻 Non-Teacher Claims
􀍻 Casual Teacher Claims for schools not using Class Cover
Current State
For (predominately) school based Casual work not covered by any Relief Teacher process (i.e. Tracer /
Class Cover) DoE currently utilise the Claims Portal as part of the MyHR Portal:
The Claims Portal allows a business development manager to:
􀍻 Choose Org Unit (i.e. School)
􀍻 Search for Employee
􀍻 Add Time Based Entry (week-by-week, retro allowed up to 12 months)
􀍻 Defaults cost assignment based on School
○ Override available in certain scenarios (e.g. additional school or project funding)
􀍻 Enter hours day-by-day
􀍻 Employee Replaced (only applicable for some entries)
􀍻 Endorse v Pre-approved
○ The logged-on user can either be pre-approved or an endorser (further approval required).
􀍻 TSS applies logic based on:
􀍻 Org Unit – Is the location eligible for the allowance? (e.g District parity / special assistance)
􀍻 Allowance $ - Does the allowance have a default classification (pay scale level)?
○ Override available in certain scenarios (e.g. determine higher classification)
􀍻 Converts many allowances to HED-019 (CASUAL PAYMENT).
􀍻 Validates employee can’t receive same ‘daily’ allowance twice (i.e. through substantive & casual
engagements.

􀍻 Costing
i. Default Costing
ii. Region Based Costing
iii. Direct / Fixed Costing
Future State - Out of The Box
In standard SuccessFactors functionality, each Casual engagement can be set up as its own work
assignment, attached to its own position that inherits the appropriate cost assignment.
In this scenario either the Casual employee themselves, or a Manager / Administrator can enter timesheets
on behalf of.
For DoE, there is no self-service element, as the Business Manager (or equivalent) enters the time relevant
to the school or location. Given the future state position management model will be utilising mass
positions the solution needs to support Casuals working over multiple locations.
In addition, specific location and award interpretation is required that renders a need for an enhancement
that mirrors the current Claims Portal functionality.
Enhancement Considerations
Given the similarities between the Claims Portal and Class Cover, the design should take account of where
the award interpretation should occur to avoid duplication of effort.
The interpretation for Casual Timesheet Extension could happen embedded in the UI (BTP Application),
within the BTP layer or within ECP.
The benefit of doing the award interpretation in ECP is irrespective of where the data is coming from (i.e.
CTE or Class Cover)
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
No enhancement in EC directly is required, all enhancement required will occur in ECP and the BTP Layer.
That said, the BTP Application to enter Casual Timesheet will be available from the Employee Central
Homepage – this Home Page tile will be controlled by Role Based Permissions to only access to relevant
personas.
BTP Application
The BTP Application should mimic the current Claims Portal, specifically this allows for the logged in user
to:
􀍲 Select School
􀍲 Select Casual Worker
􀍲 Select Time Sheet Code
􀍲 Add Hours Per Day
Page | 243
􀍲 Select Employee Replaced
􀍲 Enter Cost / Location Overrides
􀍲 Save / Endorse / Draft
Workflow
The design will cater for logged on users with differing access. In some School locations the process
maybe to endorse the timesheet entries that require final approval, whilst other locations may operate a
pre-approved process.
Replication to Payroll
All approved entries will be replicated to payroll via Employee Time Based Remuneration (Infotype 2010).
For some payment types (e.g. Teacher Aide – First Aid Allowance) they will be passed directly to Payroll
and evaluated based on the allowance configuration tables. Other payment types, (e.g. Cleaner) will be
passed to Payroll for further award interpretation to determine whether further allowances (i.e. District
Parity) is applicable at that location.
Employee Central Payroll
Within ECP, the design needs to account for the valuation of the Infotype 2010 wage types passed from
the BTP Application. The design itself will most likely use the standard PTEX2010 staging table and run the
transfer to infotype program (CAT6) directly. The ability will always exist to run this program ad-hoc as
required.
Once in Payroll, the following interpretation is required:
􀍲 Allowance Valuation Based on Constant (T510K)
􀍲 Allowance Valuation Based on Pay Scale (T510S)
􀍲 Allowance Valuation Based on Pay Scale Override (T510S)
􀍲 Cost Distribution
The valuation of allowances will be marked accordingly in the ECP Workbook.
