TASK: Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the current DoE system a claims portal is utilised for school based casual work for non-teaching positions.  Via a user interface the business manager can enter time and claims for casual non-teacher employees and casual teachers (where not using class cover).

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
By contrast, the standard behavior in SuccessFactors Time Off is to allow individuals to use timesheeting to makes claims.  But there is no school level basis for entering claims and due to the specific location and award interpretations required by DoE the standard functionality does not meet requirements.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation. This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

Task 1
================================================================================
Based on the provided context, here's an explanation of the current system and required enhancement:

## Current Department of Education (DoE) System

**Current State:**
- The DoE uses a **Claims Portal** within the MyHR Portal for school-based casual work
- Business managers can enter time and claims for:
  - Casual non-teacher employees
  - Casual teachers (in cases not using class cover)
- This portal serves as the primary interface for processing casual work claims

## SuccessFactors Standard Behavior

**Standard Functionality Limitations:**
- SuccessFactors Time Off typically allows individuals to create their own timesheets and claims
- **Missing school-level functionality** - there's no mechanism for school-based claim entry
- **Award interpretation gaps** - the system doesn't handle DoE's specific location and award requirements
- **No school-specific workflows** for business manager oversight

## Required Enhancement for Compatibility

**Solution Components:**

1. **BTP Application Development:**
   - Create a custom application to replicate current Claims Portal functionality
   - Enable business development managers to enter claims for employees in their respective schools

2. **Integration Requirements:**
   - Send claim/time data to **ECP Payroll** for processing and payment
   - Future integration capability for **Class Cover system** when operational
   - Support for **costing overrides** and **award interpretation**

3. **Key Functionalities:**
   - Single timesheet for casuals with **multiple assignments**
   - Processing of both **non-teacher and casual teacher claims**
   - **Validation mechanisms** to prevent duplicate daily allowances
   - **Business manager-driven** entry and approval workflows

4. **Administrative Benefits:**
   - Reduces assignment creation burden (currently requires separate assignments per award)
   - Decreases administrative overhead for managing casual employee records
   - Streamlines payroll processing through integrated workflow

The enhancement essentially bridges the gap between SuccessFactors' standard capabilities and DoE's specific operational requirements, particularly around school-level management and complex award interpretations.

[User Feedback]
Explain the Dependencies That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.
