TASK: The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation.
This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

  TASK : Explain the issue to me
================================================================================

Task 1
================================================================================
## Issue Explanation

### **Core Problem**
The Department of Education (DoE) currently has a gap in their payroll system where **business development managers cannot properly enter and process time/claims for casual employees**, particularly those working in schools in non-teaching roles.

### **Current State Issues**

1. **Outdated System**: Currently uses an old "Claims Portal" within the MyHR system that has limitations
2. **Assignment Proliferation**: To pay casual employees different award rates, the system requires creating **separate assignments for each different award**, leading to:
   - Excessive administrative burden
   - Too many assignments to manage
   - Increased complexity for casual employee management

3. **Integration Gap**: The time/claims data isn't properly integrated with the ECP payroll system for processing

### **Business Impact**
- **Administrative Overload**: Creating multiple assignments per casual employee for different awards
- **Inefficient Processes**: Manual claims processing through outdated portal
- **Delayed Payments**: Poor integration with payroll system
- **Scalability Issues**: As casual workforce grows, administrative burden increases exponentially

### **Proposed Solution**
Replace the current Claims Portal with a **BTP (Business Technology Platform) application** that:
- Allows business development managers to enter time and claims for employees
- Integrates with ECP payroll for automated processing
- Handles multiple assignments within single timesheets
- Will eventually integrate with class cover system when available

### **Key Enhancement**
The new system will reduce assignment creation by allowing **award interpretation to happen at the time entry level** rather than requiring separate assignments for each award type.

whats the Assumptions you made

================================================================================
Task 2
================================================================================
## Key Assumptions Made in the Proposed Solution

Based on the discussion and context provided, here are the critical assumptions underlying the proposed BTP application solution:

### **1. Award Interpretation Location Assumption**
- **Assumption**: Award interpretation logic can be successfully implemented at the time entry level within the BTP application
- **Rationale**: This avoids the need for multiple assignments per casual employee by interpreting award rates during time entry rather than requiring separate assignments for each award type
- **Dependency**: ECP must be capable of handling all award interpretation scenarios for casual timesheets from both CTE (Casual Time Entry) and Class Cover systems

### **2. Integration Capability Assumption**
- **Assumption**: The BTP application can effectively integrate with ECP payroll system for automated processing
- **Supporting Evidence**: Context indicates that award interpretation should be centralized in ECP to minimize duplication across data sources
- **Risk Consideration**: Integration must handle complex scenarios including concurrent employment and multi-assignment cases

### **3. Functional Requirements Assumption**
- **Assumption**: The enhanced solution will include:
  - Business development manager functionality for choosing org unit (school)
  - Employee search capabilities
  - Week-by-week time entry with retroactive entries up to 12 months
  - Default cost assignment based on school with override capabilities
  - Day-by-day hour entry
  - Employee replacement handling

### **4. Concurrency Management Assumption**
- **Assumption**: The system can handle concurrent employment scenarios where casual employees may have multiple assignments simultaneously
- **Consideration**: Multiple integration streams may be required for payroll, costing, and compliance in concurrent employment situations

### **5. Enhancement Scope Assumption**
- **Assumption**: Custom WRICEF enhancements can be developed to support the required functionality
- **Precedent**: Similar custom enhancements were required for disciplinary outcome management, indicating SAP SuccessFactors standard configuration may be insufficient for complex requirements

### **6. Migration Path Assumption**
- **Assumption**: The Claims Portal functionality can be successfully migrated to the BTP application without data loss or process disruption
- **Timeline**: The new system will eventually integrate with class cover system when available

### **7. Cost Assignment Logic Assumption**
- **Assumption**: Cost assignment can be handled flexibly through the new system, allowing for both default school-based assignment and override capabilities for additional school or project funding

These assumptions form the foundation for the proposed solution and will need to be validated during the design and realization phases to ensure successful implementation.

Explain how the •	The CTE application retrieves school and employee data from SuccessFactors using OData API calls

================================================================================
Task 3
================================================================================
## CTE Application Data Retrieval via OData API Calls

### **Overview of OData Integration Architecture**

The Casual Timesheet Extension (CTE) application retrieves school and employee data from SuccessFactors through standardized OData API calls, which provide a structured, RESTful approach to accessing data from the Employee Central (EC) system.

### **School Data Retrieval Process**

**Entity Types Accessed:**
- **Organization Units**: The CTE application queries `Organization` entities to retrieve school information
- **Organizational Hierarchy**: Accesses structured data showing school relationships within the department
- **Location Data**: Retrieves physical school locations and associated metadata

**OData API Endpoints:**
```
GET /odata/v2/Organization
$filter=orgType eq 'School' and status eq 'Active'
$select=externalCode, name, description, parentOrg
```

**Business Context:**
- Business development managers need to select their assigned schools
- School data includes identification codes, names, and hierarchical relationships
- Only active schools are retrieved to maintain data accuracy

### **Employee Data Retrieval Process**

**Entity Types Accessed:**
- **Employee Information**: Queries `Employee` or `PerPerson` entities
- **Employment Information**: Accesses `JobInformation` entities for current assignments
- **User Information**: Retrieves `User` entities for authentication and authorization

**OData Query Structure:**
```
GET /odata/v2/PerPerson
$expand=employmentNav
$filter=employmentNav/status eq 'Active' and employmentNav/assignmentType eq 'Casual'
$select=personIdExternal, firstName, lastName, email
```

**Search Functionality:**
- Supports employee lookup by name, ID, or other identifiers
- Filters for active casual employees within specific schools/organizations
- Returns essential employee information needed for timesheet creation

### **Authentication and Authorization Flow**

**OAuth 2.0 Integration:**
- CTE application authenticates with SuccessFactors using OAuth tokens
- Business development managers are validated against their assigned organizational permissions
- Data access is restricted based on user's organizational scope (specific schools)

**Security Considerations:**
- API calls are encrypted using HTTPS
- User permissions are validated against organizational assignment
- Only authorized employees within the user's school jurisdiction are accessible

### **Data Synchronization and Caching**

**Real-time vs. Cached Data:**
- Employee master data is typically cached to improve performance
- Organizational data may be refreshed periodically or on-demand
- Critical information like employment status is retrieved in real-time

**Error Handling:**
- Failed API calls trigger retry mechanisms
- Network timeouts are handled gracefully with user notifications
- Data consistency is maintained through transactional API calls

### **Integration with Business Logic**

**Assignment Context:**
- Retrieved employee data includes current assignment information
- Award interpretation is based on employee classification and role data
- Cost center information is derived from organizational assignment

**Workflow Integration:**
- Employee selection in CTE is validated against their active employment status
- School selection is cross-referenced with business manager's authorized scope
- Time entry data is linked to retrieved employee records for payroll processing

### **Technical Implementation Details**

**API Versioning:**
- Uses OData v2 or v4 depending on SuccessFactors instance configuration
- API endpoints are versioned to ensure backward compatibility
- Response formats follow standard OData conventions (JSON/XML)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Query parameters minimize data transfer (select specific fields)
- Filtering reduces payload size and improves response times
- Batch operations may be used for bulk data retrieval when needed

This OData integration approach ensures the CTE application has access to current, accurate employee and organizational data while maintaining security and performance standards required for payroll processing.
