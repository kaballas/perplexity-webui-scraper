Topic: E012 – AUTO PAYOUT OF PUBLIC HOLIDAYS COVERED BY LEAVE ON
TERMINATION
Should an employee terminate with positive leave balances, there is a requirement to pay any Public
Holidays that would have been covered, should the employee have taken the leave, as an ETP payment.
The following leave balances should be considered
􀁸 Annual Leave / Recreation Leave
􀁸 Long Service Leave
Current State
Currently in TSS, an employee’s termination calculation is done in the last pay period they are employed
with the Department. There is no specific intervention the payroll needs to do in order to facilitate the
Public Holiday payout on Termination.
Future State - Out of The Box
The standard process within ECP is for the Payroll Team / Administrator to run the Termination Organiser.
This process allows for payroll to manually enter any required ETP payments into the selection screen
and this then gets calculated appropriately.
Enhancement Considerations
The enhancement will need to be able to work retrospectively in case any master data changes (i.e.
termination date is adjusted) therefore it makes sense to embed this extension into the payroll schema via
a Payroll Operation.
Employees eligible for this payout should be determined by the fact they have an existing Annual /
Recreation Leave balance or Long Service Leave balance when they terminate. This logic should apply
irrespective of the termination reason.
The tax treatment of the Public Holiday on Termination is different to that if the employee observed a
public holiday, therefore the enhancement will need to consider the appropriate ETP calculation.
Even though multiple absence time accounts are applicable, the balances should be treated in parallel in
order to determine how far into the future the system should check for Public Holidays.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central Payroll
Upon termination, through BTP Extension E024 – Auto Time Off Payout of Leave Balances on
Termination, the number of hours from the final applicable leave balances will be available in the
appropriate Infotype 2010 Wage Type in payroll.
During the processing the payroll schema will call the operation if the employee has been terminated in
the pay period, the call to the operation will need to be after the import of time-based remuneration
(Infotype 2010) wage types to then check for leave balances on termination.
Once the larger balance has been determined (in hours) the operation will extrapolate out by those
number of hours based on the employee personal work schedule past their termination date.

Any Public Holidays found within those balance hours will be saved to a nominal wage type prior to
determining the final wage type with the correct ETP Tax Percentage.
ETP Calculation
The two factors that determine the ETP are:
􀍻 Preservation Age
􀍻 ETP Thresholds
Preservation age is determined by the ATO and will be determined as being 60 years of age.
The ETP thresholds are determined by Payroll Constants (T511K):
Once ETP thresholds and age have been determined, the operation will create either ETP @ 17% or ETP
@ 32% for further processing.
