TASK: Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the current DoE system a claims portal is utilised for school based casual work for non-teaching positions.  Via a user interface the business manager can enter time and claims for casual non-teacher employees and casual teachers (where not using class cover).

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
By contrast, the standard behavior in SuccessFactors Time Off is to allow individuals to use timesheeting to makes claims.  But there is no school level basis for entering claims and due to the specific location and award interpretations required by DoE the standard functionality does not meet requirements.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation. This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

Task 1
================================================================================
Based on the provided context, here's an explanation of the current system and required enhancement:

## Current Department of Education (DoE) System

**Current State:**
- DoE uses a **Claims Portal** within the MyHR Portal for school-based casual work
- Business managers currently enter time and claims for:
  - Casual non-teacher employees
  - Casual teachers (in cases where class cover is not used)
- This provides a **school-level basis** for entering claims with specific location and award interpretations

## SuccessFactors Standard Behavior Limitations

**Standard SuccessFactors Time Off functionality:**
- Allows individuals to use timesheeting to make claims
- **Lacks** a school-level basis for entering claims
- Cannot handle DoE's specific location and award interpretations
- **Does not meet requirements** for the Department's needs

## Required Enhancement Solution

**The solution involves creating a BTP (Business Technology Platform) application to:**

1. **Replace the current Claims Portal** with a Casual Timesheet Extension that:
   - Allows business development managers to enter claims for employees in their school
   - Supports multiple assignments per casual employee in a single timesheet
   - Processes both non-teacher and casual teacher claims

2. **Integration with ECP Payroll** to:
   - Send time and claims data for interpretation and payment
   - Support class cover integration when operational
   - Handle award interpretations and costing overrides

3. **Administrative Benefits:**
   - Reduces assignment creation for casual employees
   - Prevents the need for separate assignments for different awards
   - Eliminates large increases in administrative load
   - Prevents duplicate daily allowances through validation

The enhancement essentially bridges the gap between SuccessFactors standard functionality and DoE's specific school-based operational requirements.
