Topic: E002a - TEACHER VACATION PAYMENTS
Teacher vacations require processing to determine the type of payment and amount that a teacher will
receive during the set vacations of the year. There are mid-year vacations and the end of year summer
vacation payments.
Mid-year payments for permanent and fixed-term teachers are determined by distinct business rules,
which govern their compensation during the mid-year vacation.
A teacher may receive one of three summer vacation payments: Prorata Summer Vacation, Lump Sum
Summer Payment (LSSP), or Lump Sum on Termination (LSOT). The LSOT is identical to the LSSP, except it
requires an additional 10 days of service in Term 4 and 100 days of service in the school year.
There are distinct rules for the permanent and fixed-term teachers to determine if they are eligible for
Prorata Summer Vacation or LSSP.
Principals have a unique process outside of this development where they are paid their agreed roster
during the vacations.
Current State
TSS has been custom built to meet the complex requirements as outlined in the EBA, but current state can
be summarised at a high level as follows:
Mid-Year Vacation
A Mid-Year Vacation is defined as being Autumn, Winter and Spring breaks and may include school
holidays, public holidays and Professional Development Days (i.e. Student Free Days).
The following Teachers are eligible for Mid-Year Vacation payments:
􀍻 Permanent Teachers
○ Paid unless on extended LWOP or
○ Employment is ceased prior to the vacation
􀍻 Fixed Term (Temporary) Teachers
○ Paid if employed either side of the vacation period
○ Payment based on conditions (e.g. FTE %) of last day of prior term
􀍻 Part Time Teachers
○ Paid for Professional Development Days at full time equivalent irrespective of their usual
roster.
The following arrangements apply:
􀍻 Mid-Year Vacation is paid at the employee’s ordinary hourly rate.
􀍻 Where paid leave is taken across vacation periods (e.g. LSL), no deduction from the time account
is debited.
􀍻 Public Holidays within a vacation period are only paid if they fall on the Teacher’s planned roster.

Summer Vacation
The Summer Vacation is defined as starting after Term 4 and is from December to January. Current state
means Teachers can receive either 1 of 4 Summer Vacation payments:
Note, moving forward Lump Sum Prorata (HED-035) will no longer be applicable and Teacher’s in this
category will instead receive Prorata (Summer Vacation).
Future State - Out of The Box
Whilst SuccessFactors offers flexible and rule-based configuration to manage leave and absence
payments, the specific requirements of DoE specific to the Education sector where Term Dates and
Vacation Periods are set on an annual basis will require an enhancement.
Enhancement Considerations
The key enhancement consideration is how the Vacation Payments process integrates with the standard
payroll processing in Employee Central Payroll.
Whilst the requirements require specific processing at certain points of the year (most notably the Payroll
Period that the Summer Vacation begins in), the design must allow for seamless retrospective processing
Page | 204
and catering for not only Mid-Year Vacations but also for teachers as and when they transition from Fixed
Term / Casual / Permanent and vice versa.
The enhancement considerations must identify the following data points in the SuccessFactors solution
with specific reference to:
Fixed Term (Temporary) Teachers
The following is a simplified eligibility criteria for Fixed Term Teachers for Summer Vacation payments
Prorata (Summer Vacation)
􀍻 Full Year Employment
􀍻 Partial Year Employment
􀍻 State High School Teachers
􀍻 Breaks in Service
􀍻 Casual Supply Teaching
􀍻 Following School Year Condition
Lump Sum Summer Payment (LSSP)
􀍻 Complete > 100 days of service in the School Year
􀍻 Work the entire Semester 2
Lump Sum On Termination (LSOT)
􀍻 Paid if Teacher is not eligible for Prorata or LSSP
􀍻 Based on notional entitlement of 20 days Annual Leave
􀍻 Any Mid-Year Vacation payments paid are deducted from calculated accrued annual leave.
Permanent Teachers
Permanent Teachers will receive full summer vacation payments or a Prorata payment based on eligible
service, FTE changes and leave exclusions.
Eligible Service
􀍻 Service from Permanent Appointment
􀍻 Any continuous fixed term service immediately before the Permanent Appointment
􀍻 Any non-continuous fixed term service (where total breaks to Permanent Appointment does not
exceed 9 school days)
􀍻 Casual Supply Teaching (note, as Casual Leave Loading, this counts only for Service calculations).
Exclusions
􀁸 Permanent Teachers who resign prior to Summer Vacation will receive either LSOT or LSSP
􀁸 Permanent Teachers on Pay Suspend during the Summer Vacation
􀁸 Principals will get Vacation payments based on their roster (i.e. not pro-rated).
Leave & FTE Impact
􀁸 LWOP > 30 School Days reduces Summer Vacation Payment.
􀁸 Changes in FTE throughout the School Year reduces Summer Vacation Payment and is calculated
on an average FTE based on hours worked over the School Year.
Page | 205
Alternative Cost Distribution
Dedicated cost centres (per Region) apply for vacation payments paid to School Funded staff.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
The majority of processing for this BTP Extension will occur within ECP and the BTP Layer; however,
employees are required to preview or project their Summer Vacation hours via Employee Self Service.
The decision to indeed allow employees to project their hours will be made as part of the implementation,
however if required a Home page tile could be made available (say from October onwards) and this could
allow for a simulation of Summer Vacation Hours. This requirement will be supported by the creation of an
Employee Central MDF Object and Portlet for Summer Vacation.
Employee Central Payroll
The intention is to embed the School Vacation payments within the Payroll processing via a custom
payroll operation. This is to take advantage of the standard SAP retro processing in Payroll and in order to
only process the logic for the appropriate employee groups in the relevant payroll periods.
Furthermore, this also allows for the integration of the logic within the termination processing in SAP.
In order to reduce the processing time, the necessary information to make the calculations will be stored
in custom tables in ECP itself. In retrospective pay periods the payroll operation will dynamically recalculate
the payment if the system date is greater than the calculation timestamp.
Based on the Summer Vacation eligibility criteria, the following data element attributes apply: (Note, the
full data model will be in the Specification document, however the following gives an indication of all the
required data points):

E002b - TEACHER AIDE VACATION PAYMENTS
Teacher Aide Vacation payments are somewhat different to Teacher Vacation Payments, in the sense for
the Summer Vacation they will be paid off their accrued Annual Leave. However, for Mid-Year Vacation
payments there is a requirement to check eligibility.
The Standard Job Model (SJM), introduced as part of the Department of Education Teacher Aides’
Certified Agreement 2022, replaced previous ADO provisions. This model was designed to simplify and
standardise employment arrangements by providing for payment of ordinary wages during school
vacation periods, when Teacher Aides are not required to attend work.
Current State
Vacation payment is based on the employee’s FTE % as at the last day of term. If an employee has
multiple Teacher Aide assignments, an average FTE % is used.
Teacher Aide’s will be paid for a school vacation period based on their roster (ordinary hours) prior to
vacation regardless of fraction changes to ordinary hours of employment during the term prior to the
school vacation or leave without pay taken.
No wages over school vacation will be payable where a Teacher Aide has been on leave without pay for a
whole term or longer.
Teacher Aides get a percentage of the vacation period (Easter/Winter/Spring) paid depending on the
percentage of the previous term worked.
Currently Teacher Aide’s working in Youth Detention Centres are dealt with as a manual workaround.
Future State - Out of The Box
For the Summer Vacation, the intention is Teacher Aide’s will be paid Annual Leave that they have accrued
throughout the year. This can be met through standard out of the box configuration. For Mid-Year Vacation
payments, a BTP extension is required.
Enhancement Considerations
The enhancement needs to consider the specific conditions within the Teacher Aide’s Certified Agreement
2022:
Standard Job Model (SJM) and Vacation Payment Structure:
Vacation payments for Teacher Aides are governed by the Standard Job Model (SJM), which requires
working an additional 12.5% of ordinary hours during the term. These hours are deferred and used to
calculate payments for specified school vacation periods (Easter, Winter, Spring). The SJM also applies to
most Teacher Aides, including those in rural or remote schools, with specific rules for Youth Detention
Centres.
Annual Leave and Summer Vacation Provisions:
During the Summer Vacation, Teacher Aides must take Annual Leave at the start, covering 24 days
(including public holidays and a concessional day). Any remaining days are covered by the SJM. Paid
Page | 208
leave during the term counts as service for vacation eligibility, while paid leave during vacation does not
reduce leave balances.
Eligibility and Pro Rata Entitlement Rules:
Vacation payment eligibility is based on the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) fraction at term end, including
combined FTE for multiple engagements. Pro rata payments apply if the Teacher Aide was not engaged
for two or more weeks or took two or more weeks of unpaid leave (excluding workers’ compensation
leave). No minimum service period is required for eligibility.
Service Recognition and Exclusions:
Only service as a temporary or permanent Teacher Aide counts toward vacation payment eligibility.
Periods of casual employment or employment in other roles are excluded. Parental Leave is exclusive of
school vacation periods.
Special Arrangements and Preserved Teacher Aides:
Teacher Aides on preserved arrangements do not receive paid vacation unless they transition to the SJM
by working the additional 12.5%. Youth Detention Centre Teacher Aides follow a different vacation
schedule aligned with workforce rotation rather than the standard school calendar. That is, Youth
Detention Centres get 55 days per year, most have to take 4 weeks in the Summer Vacation then the rest
whenever. Some locations have 2 weeks at the start of the year meaning they may go negative.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
There is no enhancement required in EC for this extension.
Employee Central Payroll
As with Teacher Vacation payments, the intention is to embed the Teacher Mid-Year Vacation payments
within the Payroll processing via a custom payroll operation. This is to take advantage of the standard SAP
retro processing in Payroll and in order to only process the logic for the appropriate employee groups in
the relevant payroll periods.
Furthermore, this also allows for the integration of the logic within the termination processing in SAP.
In order to reduce the processing time, the necessary information to make the calculations will be stored
in custom tables in ECP itself. In retrospective pay periods the payroll operation will dynamically recalculate
the payment if the system date is greater than the calculation timestamp.

Round 2 - Critique
================================================================================
# SAP SuccessFactors Quality Assurance Review: Teacher & Teacher Aide Vacation Payment System

## Executive Summary
This quality assurance review assesses the metadata extraction for the Teacher & Teacher Aide Vacation Payment system within Queensland Department of Education's SAP SuccessFactors implementation. The review identifies 15 critical issues, 8 high-priority concerns, and 12 medium-priority recommendations requiring immediate attention.

**Overall Assessment: RED - Major Revisions Required**

---

## 1. Critical Quality Issues

### 1.1 Missing Data Validation Rules (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** No validation rules defined for critical fields in MDF objects
- `paymentHours` could accept negative values
- `currentFTE` and `averageFTE` lack range validation (should be 0-1 or 0-100%)
- `serviceDays` lacks business rule validation

**Recommendation:** Implement field-level validation rules:
```
paymentHours: >= 0 AND <= 2000 per annum
FTE fields: >= 0 AND <= 1 (decimal format) OR >= 0 AND <= 100 (percentage format)
serviceDays: >= 0 AND <= 365
```

### 1.2 Inconsistent Data Types (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Inconsistent field definitions across MDF objects
- `ftePercentage` in Teacher Aide object vs `currentFTE`/`averageFTE` in Teacher object
- Mixed date formats and precision levels
- Inconsistent string length definitions

**Recommendation:** Standardize field naming and data types:
```
Standard FTE field: qld_fte_percentage (Decimal 5,4)
Standard date format: YYYY-MM-DD
Consistent string lengths: Employee ID (10), Assignment ID (20)
```

### 1.3 Missing Business Rule Dependencies (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Business rules lack dependency mapping and error handling
- No fallback logic for missing data
- No conflict resolution between competing rules
- Missing rule precedence definitions
