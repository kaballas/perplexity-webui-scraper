TASK: Relieving Above Level
A higher duties arrangement (or relieve above level) occurs where an employee is directed to assume the
duties of a classification above their existing role for the “minimum period”, as specified in Higher Duties
(Directive 16/24).
Where this occurs, the employee will be entitled to payment at the higher rate for the period for which
they are required to undertake higher duties. While higher duties arrangements are often utilised to fill
Page | 67
temporary vacancies within a business unit, an employee may perform higher duties in a different business
unit, which may be covered by an award other than the employee’s substantive award.
Employee Central supports this type of assignment if it is done within the same legal entity of the
employee as well as if the employee group, employee subgroup, and same pay frequency.
Employees will have ability to fulfil higher duty arrangement at a defined percentage which could be
100%, 50% or as per the role requirement. This can be entered when the higher duties assignment is
created.
Relevant user will initiate and create the relieving above level or temporary assignment process. There will
be workflow assigned to creation and deletion of higher duty or temporary assignment requests. Once the
higher duty or temporary assignment is active, it will be associated closely with the corresponding nominal
assignment of the employee. A new employment will be created in case of Higher Duties assignment of an
employee.
An employee in a higher duty or temporary assignment position can hold one of the following
responsibility types:
􀍻 Individual Contributor: The employee won't have any delegations or responsibilities related to the
directs (if any) of the new assignment position.
􀍻 Only Delegation: The employee will have only delegations of the incumbent of the new
assignment position, but not other responsibilities such as talent management aspects.
􀍻 Full Responsibility: The employee will have complete responsibility of the new assignment
position including talent management aspects related to the directs of the new position. Full
responsibility will be the default option when higher duties record is created for an employee in
DOE.
An employee in a higher duties arrangement (or relief above level) position in Higher Duties - Promotional
Teachers scenario will be eligible for an additional Higher Duty Allowance using Promotional Calculation
method. The estimated higher duty allowance will be difference between pay component 1010 – Base
Salary between minimum paypoint of current pay band and minimum paypoint of the new pay band.
An employee in a higher duties arrangement (or relief above level) position in all other scenarios will be
eligible for an additional Higher Duty Allowance using standard calculation method. The estimated higher
duty allowance will be difference between pay component 1010 – Base Salary between current pay scale
level and new pay scale level.
The employee will continue to hold the substantive role in a separate profile with right to return on the
substantive position. The system will be set up to automatically return the employee to substantive
position on end date of Higher duties.

Higher Duties
Overview
Teachers who are performing higher duties immediately before the summer vacation (i.e. end of Term 4)
will be paid higher duties amount for the annual leave period (the first 4 weeks of the summer vacation
period). The higher duties rate will also be payable for the three public holidays and the concessional day.
In total a period of 24 days.
􀍻 Where there is a variance to FTE hours, prorata rules will apply.
􀍻 For teachers engaged at schools which have a 7-week summer vacation, the entitlement is 29
days (25 days annual leave + 3 public holidays + concessional day).
􀍻 Remainder of vacation period is paid at substantive rate (vacation leave) unless the teacher has
performed higher duties all year, and the engagement is extended into the new year on the other
side of the summer vacation
􀍻 Leave loading will be paid on the employee’s salary rate that they are being paid as at end of
Term 4 (i.e. 03 December for 7-week school and 10 December for 6-week schools).
􀍻 Employees are due full summer vacation at higher duties rate where the engagement is extended
to end of vacation or into the next school year
Calculation
􀍻 A teacher who relieves a head of program or school leader shall be paid a higher duties
allowance which will consist of the relevant percentage of the difference between the relieving
teacher's normal salary and the salary which the teacher would be paid if actually employed in the
head of program or school leader position.
A teacher who relieves a head of program or school leader assigned to a higher salary band shall be paid
a higher duties allowance which will consist of the relevant percentage of the difference between the
minimum salary of the salary band to which the relieving teacher's normal position is assigned and the
minimum salary of the higher salary band. Note
, the Higher Duties paid in ECP will be based on a Pay Component amount passed down from Employee
Central.
Note, the Higher Duties paid in ECP will be based on a Pay Component amount passed down from
Employee Central.

Future State - Out of The Box
Given the EBA specific rules associated with Salary Increment, there is no equivalent functionality existing
in SuccessFactors, hence a custom extension is required.
Enhancement Considerations
Overview
Increments for Department of Education employees are influenced by several key components:
􀍻 Period of Service/Tenure: This refers to the duration an employee has served at an assigned
Classification and Paypoint. Increments for departmental employees are typically awarded
annually or bi-annually based on this tenure. Breaks in service will impact of incremental
progression.
􀍻 Periods of Eligible Higher Duties Service: Employees who assume higher duties may have this
service recognised towards their increment on the base or substantive classification.
􀍻 Service Exclusions Due to Leave Without Pay: Certain unpaid leave types as outlined under
the schedule of directive - leave without salary credited as service, including but not limited to
conditions for sick, parental, and other special leave may result in an exclusion for increment
calculation purposes. For example, an employee on Parental Leave no pay for 12 months will
have the first three months credited as eligible service for incremental progression. The remaining
9 months of leave period will be an exclusion.
Page | 195
In addition to the above classifications, the following factors apply when determining the increment date:
􀍻 Performing Duties at the Same or Lower Classification:
○ Service performed at the same salary classification level is counted towards the employee's
increment.
○ Service performed at a lower salary classification level is not counted towards the
employee's substantive salary classification increment. This would constitute as a break in
service for increment purposes when calculating the employees base/substantive
incremental progression. Applies to all employee types.
○ Cross counting rules. DoE currently maintain a table which governs which roles count as
service towards other roles for increments. For example, service as a Teacher may count
towards service as a Teacher Aide, but not vice versa.
􀍻 Performing Duties at a Higher Classification:
○ Service performed at a higher classification level is counted towards the substantive position.
○ For temporary employees, Higher Duties refer to situations where an engagement at a lower
classification ends to begin another engagement at a higher classification. If re- engaged at a
later point at the lower classification, the service previously completed at the higher
classification should count towards the lower one, provided that the break in service is not
greater than 12 months (for non-teachers).
○ When a temporary teacher performs contracts (consecutive or concurrent) at a higher
classification level, the service in the higher classification counts towards the increment in the
lower classification, but not vice versa.
○ Dependant on certain criteria, employees performing higher duties may be eligible for an
increment on the higher classification level. Refer Higher duties directive (12 months service
within 24-month period).
○ Cross counting rules. DoE currently maintain a table which governs which roles count as
service towards other roles for increments. For example, service as a Teacher may count
towards service as a Teacher Aide, but not vice versa.
􀍻 Concurrent Employment:
○ Employee working in two separate roles at the same time e.g., Admin Officer 0.6FTE &
Teacher Aide 0.4FTE, will be entitled to increment in each position separately.
􀍻 Payroll Maintenance of Salary Increments:
○ The ability to manually adjust (Bring forward or delay) is required - Includes Calendar Days,
School Days, Hours. For example, if an employee has 8 months service with Queensland
Health as an AO301 and transfers to DoE at the same level, they would only need to serve 4
months before being entitled to increment. In this case an entry of 8 months is manually
entered by a payroll operator the system will automatically apply the increment after a
further 4 months service.

E026 – LEAVE RATE INCLUSIVE OF HIGHER DUTIES WHEN HD
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES ELIGIBLE ABSENCE
As per the Higher Duties directive, the payment of certain leave types during and immediately following a
period of Higher Duties are required to be paid inclusive of the higher rate:
Payment of higher duties amount during recreation leave, long service leave and paid
parental leave
An employee who takes recreation leave, long service leave or paid parental leave during a relieving
period is entitled to be paid for the full period of such leave at the higher duties amount being paid
to the employee immediately before the employee takes the leave. This will be the case even where
the relieving period ceases on the last day of duty prior to the leave commencing, or at any point
during the leave period
Current State
The functionality has been in-built in TSS and processes the following leave types
􀁸 Long Service Leave
􀁸 Paid Parental
􀁸 Annual / Recreation Leave
Future State - Out of The Box
EC Payroll will natively pay appropriate leave types inclusive of the Higher Duties rate where the leave is
taken during the relieving period, however an extension is required to maintain that higher rate even after
the higher duties has finished.
Enhancement Considerations
The enhancement needs to consider a number of factors to ensure compliance with the Higher Duties
directive.
Identify the end of the relieving period, noting this could fall in a previous pay period, as well as confirming
the Long Service Leave, Paid Parental (of which there could be multiple variants) and Annual / Recreation
Leave has started immediately following the period of higher duties has ended.
Furthermore, the processing must identify any scenarios where the leave and the period of higher duties
overlaps to ensure the remainder of the leave is continued to be paid at the higher rate.
Finally, the enhancement must be able to identify periods of consecutive leave that is not broken by either
a working day, or another leave type that does not attract the same entitlement (e.g. sick leave).
Enhancement Design
Employee Central Payroll
A payroll operation is required to be executed, triggered by the presence of an appropriate leave wage
type (e.g. Long Service Leave), to then determine whether a higher duties rate needs to be applied.
Page | 240
Given the pay period in question could be mid-way through the leave and/or completely outside of the
relieving period, the operation will query the preceding pay period to ascertain whether the higher rate is
applicable.
To reduce the payroll processing time as much as possible, the simplest way to achieve this is to have the
payroll operation generate a notional wage type to flag that eligible leave types have immediately
followed higher duties.
As such the enhancement design should consider:
􀍻 Eligible Leave
○ Determine the eligible leave type through a custom processing class setting against the leave
wage type. Using the processing class configuration negates the need to hard code the wage
types themselves and therefore future proofs the operation design for any change in policy.
○ Enhancement must consider consecutive periods of eligible leave
􀍻 Higher Duties and Personal Work Schedule
○ Once the leave is identified, determine the existence of higher duties and ensure no working
day, with direct reference to the employees’ personal work schedule, exists between the last
day of the relieving period.
􀍻 Higher Duties Rate of Pay
○ Determine the applicable hourly rate of pay to apply to the eligible leave type. There are a
number of ways to achieve this, the operation itself could derive the rate of pay of the higher
duties or similarly a notional pay component from EC could store the HD rate of pay.
○ Once determined the rate of pay of the HD is added to the employee’s normal rate of pay for
leave to achieve the higher rate.
○ The design should take account of business-as-usual changes in an employee’s rate of pay.
This could include a EBA pay increase against the substantive position, a retrospective pay
increase in the relieving position or the application of a new recurring allowance

1	Introduction
1.1	Overview
Current Department of Education (DoE) System
DoE employees on Higher Duties (HD) who take Annual / Recreational Leave (RL), Paid Parental Leave (PPL), or Long Service Leave (LSL) immediately following the HD period are paid at the HD rate during their leave.  If the HD period ends during the leave, the leave continues to be paid at the HD rate.  This applies even if the leave includes multiple types taken consecutively (e.g., 1 week of LSL followed by 1 week of RL).
However, if there is a gap between the end of the HD period and the start of the leave, the system checks for any working days in that gap.  If working days exist, the HD rate does not apply, and the leave is paid at the employee's standard rate.

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
In SuccessFactors, a cloud-based platform, the HD rate is applied only during the HD period.  Any leave taken after the HD period ends is paid at the employee’s standard rate, regardless of the timing or type of leave.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
To align with the DoE’s requirements, an enhancement in the Employee Central Payroll (ECP) system is needed to ensure that leave payments are processed at the HD rate when applicable, as per the DoE’s rules, including handling consecutive leave types and checking for gaps with working days.

1.2	Assumptions
The leave types are identified by a classification class in the customer range.

1.3	Dependencies

2	System Design
2.1	High Level Design
This high-level design outlines the implementation of a custom payroll operation in the Employee Central Payroll (ECP) system to align leave payment processing with the Department of Education (DoE) rules for employees on Higher Duties (HD). The standard SuccessFactors behavior pays leaves at the employee's normal rate after the HD period ends, but DoE requires paying certain leaves (Recreational Leave - RL, Paid Parental Leave - PPL, Long Service Leave - LSL) at the HD rate if they immediately follow or overlap with the HD period, including handling consecutive leave types and gaps with working days.
The custom logic will be encapsulated in a payroll operation (e.g., a Personnel Calculation Rule or Operation in SAP Payroll schema) that is invoked during payroll processing. This operation will evaluate HD assignments via available wagetypes, check leave timing and conditions, and adjust pay rates accordingly.

2.2	Key DoE Rules (Basis for Enhancement)
•	Eligible Leaves: Annual / Recreational Leave - RL, Paid Parental Leave - PPL, Long Service Leave – LSL.  Identified by the custom classification case. (91 as an example)
•	HD Rate Application:
o	Pay at HD rate if leave starts immediately (taking into account non working days) after or during HD, or continues from a previous pay period with HD.
o	Consecutive leaves (e.g. 1 week LSL + 1 week RL) are treated as a single block.
o	If a gap exists between HD end and the leave start, check for working days in the gap.  If none then apply HD rate, otherwise exit processing.
o	The HD rate is passed from the EC system as a pay component. (e.g. HDHR – Higher Duties Hourly Rate)
•	Leave Processing:
o	Identify if the current payroll period contains RL, PPL, or LSL.
o	For leaves starting in the period:  Check if Higher Duties preceded the leave start.  Take into account any splits during the period.
o	For ongoing leaves:  If the Higher Duties exist during the leave check for the HD rate to see if it ends in the current period.   If it does assign the HD Rate to the notional wage type 9001 if it does.
o	Leave exists without HD:  Check previous period for HD assignment via the 9001 notional wage type – this would contain the HD rate from the last day of HD.  Adjust the base rate (/001) by adding the HD rate.
•	School Vacation Processing:
o	When checking the gap between end of HD and the start of leave if the employee is employed at a school then the school vacation periods must be taken into account. (See Example Case 2)
•	Data Sources:
o	Infotype 0509: HD assignment details (start/end dates)
o	Infotype 2001: Absence records (leave type, start/end dates).
o	Infotype 0008: Basic pay details for normal rate and pay rise detection (e.g., effective dates of wage type changes).
o	Employee master data: Work schedule (for gap analysis).

2.3	Logic Flow
The ZHDL operation processes each employee in the payroll period as follows:
Identify Eligible Leaves in Payroll Period:
Query Infotype 2001 for RL, PPL, LSL records overlapping the payroll period identified via their custom classification class.
Group consecutive leaves (e.g., LSL followed by RL with no gap) as a single block.
If none of these leave types are found in the period – then exit the operation.
Determine Leave Start:
If the leave is continuing during through this pay period then check to see if HD is being applied during this period (If HD is already active against leave – do nothing) - if not then read the previous period results table LRT to find the WT9001 which contains the HD rate.  Adjust the /001 base rate for the current payroll period until the leave ends or the current period ends.  Then exit the operation.
If the leave is starting during this payroll period or the HD is no longer active against the leave during this period (or on the last day of the period) then we need to determine if HD applies.
Check HD Preceding Leave (For Leaves Starting in Period):
Retrieve HD assignments from Infotype 509 (current period – 3 months – [to cater for summer vacations]).
If HD active (HD_END >= LEAVE_START):
Find the HD rate and pass to WT9001.  Apply HD rate to the leave via /001 if the HD has ended in this period.
If HD ended before leave start (HD_END < LEAVE_START):
Calculate gap (LEAVE_START - HD_END - 1).
Check gap for working days via the working day class in table PERWS using employee’s work schedule via function module HR_PERSONAL_WORK_SCHEDULE.  Day type can be used to determine summer vacation etc
If no working days, determine the HD rate and add to /001;  otherwise exit the operation.
HD Differential and Output Wage Type:
Using the HD end date, find the HD rate wage type from the IT internal table if the HD end date is in the current period otherwise read internal table ORT.  If it doesn’t match on dates then read database table HRDCT_TPY_RGDIR to find the period the HD ended in via the FPBEG and FPEND fields.  Using the SEQNR find the HD rate from table P2RX_RT accounting for splits.
Pass the HD rate to WT9001.
Read the base rate (/001) from the IT table.  Add the WT9001 to the base rate and pass it back to the OT table.

2.4	Example Cases
Case 1
Any DoE employee performing higher duties who then takes Leave directly after (No working days) will be eligible for the higher rate.
Case 2
A teacher is paid higher duties at the end of term 4 and are then paid their summer vacation payments for the first 24 days of the holiday.  If they then take LSL, RL or PPL Leave after the 24 days (Which coincides with the student free days) they are paid at the HD rate.

2.5	Reporting
For the case where a HD rate increases during HD relevant leave – there needs to be a process to potentially adjust the payment for an employee.  A report can be run via looking for base salary changes for an employee assignment while they are on HD leave or via payroll results looking for the notional wage type 9001 showing the payment of the higher rate.

2.6	Concurrent Employment (CE) Considerations
The HD is at assignment level and the operation will process each assignment separately
3	Implementation and Usage
3.1	Cutover – Data Migration Considerations
Previous HD and Leave records will be required in EC/ECP to determine the correct rate to pay an employee.

The following feedback was given on my design, please help me to address the gaps mentioned and list the ones thats not gaps


Fact-Check Analysis Tasks for CTE Specification

Category: Technical (Solution Approach)
Issue: Reliance on a custom payroll operation (ZHDL) instead of leveraging SuccessFactors native capabilities
Context Contradiction: The specification proposes an on-premise style ABAP payroll operation in ECP to handle higher duties leave payments, whereas SuccessFactors cloud best practices encourage using standard features or side-by-side extensions (e.g. EC Time Off rules or BTP services)
help.sap.com
. The Higher Duty Allowance infotype 0509 already exists in ECP
help.sap.com
, suggesting some standard integration for higher duties. However, the spec bypasses EC’s native logic by custom coding.
Impact Assessment: Over-customization could increase maintenance complexity and diverge from SAP’s upgrade-safe cloud approach. If the native EC/ECP integration for higher duties (infotype 0509 and pay component mapping) is not utilized, the solution might duplicate standard functionality or become brittle with future updates.
Verification Required: Confirm via SAP documentation whether Employee Central and Employee Central Payroll can natively accommodate the higher duties leave uplift (for example, checking if infotype 0509 and standard payroll rules could handle leave at higher rate during/after acting period). Evaluate if a Business Technology Platform (BTP) extension or EC Time Management configuration could achieve the same outcome with less custom ABAP. This may involve consulting SAP’s Higher Duty Assignment implementation guide
help.sap.com
 and validating if the custom operation is truly necessary or if the requirement can be met through configuration and EC Time Off rules.

Category: Architectural (EC–ECP Integration)
Issue: Insufficient detail on data flow and integration between Employee Central and ECP for higher duties and leave data
Context Contradiction: The spec notes that the higher duty rate is passed from EC as a pay component (e.g. HDHR – Higher Duties Hourly Rate), but does not detail how this information is transferred or mapped into payroll (infotype/wage type) for calculation. The Higher Duty directive requires maintaining the HD rate into certain leave periods
help.sap.com
help.sap.com
, yet the integration steps (such as EC field mapping to IT0509 or usage of IT2010 for allowances) are not explicitly documented. The context implies a workflow and data replication (since a new employment is created for higher duties in EC), but the spec’s integration section is sparse.
Impact Assessment: Without explicit integration mapping, critical data might not reach payroll or could be misinterpreted. For example, if the HD pay component isn’t properly replicated to ECP’s infotype 0509 or to the custom wage type (9001) in the payroll schema, the higher duties allowance will not be applied on leave payments as intended. This gap can lead to payroll errors where employees don’t receive the correct rate during eligible leave, violating DoE’s rules.
Verification Required: Document the end-to-end integration points. Specifically, verify how EC’s Higher Duties assignment (likely stored via infotype 0509 in ECP
help.sap.com
 or a similar mechanism) and EC Time Off records (IT2001 in payroll) flow into ECP. Confirm the wage type mapping for the HD allowance (e.g. mapping EC pay component to an ECP allowance wage type)
help.sap.com
. Outline the BAPI/OData calls or replication jobs involved when a higher duty assignment starts/ends and when a leave record is created. This task includes checking if a custom BTP integration is needed to flag the end of higher duty into payroll (for continuing leave payments), or if the standard EC-ECP replication can be configured to handle this (perhaps by extending the employee master data replication to carry a flag or rate). Testing with a sample scenario in a QA system would be ideal to ensure all necessary fields (e.g. HD end date, HD rate) are passed correctly into payroll for the calculation.

Category: Process (Business Scenario Coverage)
Issue: Incomplete handling of complex teacher assignment scenarios in the specification
Context Contradiction: The Queensland DoE rules for higher duties have special cases for teachers, especially around school vacation periods and varying term lengths
help.sap.com
help.sap.com
. The specification provides one example (a teacher performing higher duties at end of Term 4, then taking leave across summer vacation), but it doesn’t explicitly cover all nuanced scenarios. For instance, teachers at schools with a 7-week summer break are entitled to 29 days at the higher rate
leanx.eu
, and those who performed higher duties all year and continue into the new school year should receive the full summer vacation at the higher rate
help.sap.com
. It’s unclear if the design’s logic (checking for non-working day gaps) fully captures this or how the system will know a school’s term structure. Also, scenarios with partial FTE variances and consecutive different leave types (LSL followed by RL, etc.) need to be explicitly handled as a single block
help.sap.com
help.sap.com
.
Impact Assessment: If these real-world cases are not thoroughly addressed, the payroll system may miscalculate leave payments for some teachers – for example, reverting to substantive pay too early for a teacher at a 7-week school or mishandling back-to-back leave types. This would breach the directive (e.g. paying only 24 days at higher rate when 29 are due, or not paying higher rate for a second leave type taken immediately after the first) and could lead to disputes or the need for manual corrections.
Verification Required: Cross-check each DoE rule against the specification logic. Verify that the design covers both 6-week and 7-week vacation schools (perhaps via configuration of school calendars or an attribute in employee data indicating vacation length). Confirm how the system identifies “no working day” gaps during school holidays versus actual breaks in service – e.g., ensure that scheduled student-free days or term start dates are considered non-working appropriately so the higher duty rate continues for the correct duration. Test a scenario where a teacher’s higher duties position is extended into the new year to see if the logic correctly grants the full vacation period at the higher rate (this may require simulating an assignment extension that ends on the first day of Term 1). Additionally, validate the handling of consecutive leave types: for instance, one week of long service leave followed immediately by annual leave should be treated as continuous leave for higher duties purposes
help.sap.com
. Any gaps identified in these scenarios should lead to refinements in the rules engine or additional conditions in the payroll operation/BTP logic.

Category: Data Model Consistency
Issue: Use of on-premise SAP data structures without mapping to SuccessFactors data model
Context Contradiction: The spec references traditional SAP payroll concepts (Infotypes 0509, 2001, 0008; wage types; clusters like IT, ORT, LRT, etc.) in describing the solution. However, it does not clarify the Employee Central side data model or how these map to EC objects. SuccessFactors EC terminology (e.g. Job Information, Compensation Information, Time Off records) is largely absent. The reviewer’s feedback suggests the design should be reframed in terms of SF cloud constructs – for example, defining a Higher Duties assignment likely as a concurrent employment or MDF object in EC, and describing leave using Time Off requests rather than directly Infotype 2001 (which is an ECP artifact). While ECP will ultimately use infotypes, the functional spec should bridge how EC data feeds those structures
help.sap.com
.
Impact Assessment: This gap can cause misunderstandings for implementation teams. For instance, developers or consultants working on the EC configuration might not know where to store or how to trigger the higher duties info if the spec only mentions infotypes (which are maintained in payroll). A lack of SF-specific data modeling could also mean missing configuration in EC (such as not creating the necessary pay components or fields to capture HD details) that are crucial for the integration. Inconsistencies here risk data misalignment – e.g., higher duty allowance might be calculated in payroll but not visible or reportable in EC, or vice versa.
Verification Required: Align each SAP element with an EC counterpart. Verify that Higher Duty assignments are captured in EC via either the standard “Concurrent Employment/Global Assignment” functionality or a custom MDF object (as indicated by EC’s support for higher duties replication to IT0509
help.sap.com
). Confirm that pay components for higher duties (the “HDHR” hourly rate, or a differential allowance component) exist in EC’s data model and are configured to replicate to ECP wage types. Map leave records from EC Time Off to the corresponding absence infotypes in ECP, and ensure the spec explains this flow. Essentially, update the design to use EC terms for the source data (e.g., “Higher Duties Allowance MDF and Pay Component in EC, replicated to infotype 0509 in ECP”), so that the architecture is clear in cloud context. This can be verified by reviewing EC implementation guides or existing EC configuration for DoE to see how higher duties and relevant leave data are structured on the EC side.

Feedback Items Evaluated as Non-Gaps

Real-World Teacher Scenarios: Partially Covered. The specification already includes a teacher scenario (higher duties over summer vacation in Example Case 2), addressing the core rule of paying vacation at the higher rate. This indicates the design is aware of teacher-specific requirements; the task is to extend it with additional variations rather than a completely missing piece.

Use of SAP Structures in ECP: Intentional Design Choice. References to infotypes and wage types are appropriate for the ECP context (since ECP uses SAP HCM schema under the hood). The key is clarifying their linkage to EC, not necessarily removing them. Thus, this is a matter of documentation clarity rather than a functional gap – the design can retain SAP terms but should also describe the EC perspective to satisfy cloud architecture standards.

Based on the comprehensive research conducted and analysis of the feedback against your design specification, here is the structured evaluation:

## **Analysis of Feedback Items**

### **LEGITIMATE GAPS - Must Address**

#### **1. Insufficient EC-to-ECP Integration Documentation**
**Status**: Valid Gap
**Evidence**: The feedback correctly identifies missing integration mapping details. Your specification mentions "the HD rate is passed from EC as a pay component (e.g., HDHR)" but lacks explicit documentation of:
- How EC pay components map to IT0509 fields in ECP
- The replication mechanism (P2P integration, BAdI HRSFEC_B_CE_CHANGE_IT0509)
- Wage type mapping configuration (V_512W_D, V_T54C3)
- How the HD allowance differential is calculated in ECP vs. EC estimation

**Action Required**:
1. Add explicit section documenting EC data model → ECP infotype mapping
2. Specify which EC objects store HD rate (MDF objects, pay component group configuration)
3. Document replication configuration requirements (filter settings for IT0509 by country)
4. Clarify relationship between EC's "estimated HD allowance" and ECP's actual calculation

#### **2. EC Data Model Terminology Gap**
**Status**: Valid Gap
**Evidence**: The specification uses exclusively ECP/ABAP terminology (IT0509, IT2001, IT0008, LRT, ORT tables) without bridging to EC concepts. Standard documentation shows:
- EC uses "Global Assignment" or "concurrent employment" for HD assignments
- Time Off requests in EC replicate to IT2001 in ECP
- Pay components in EC map to wage types in ECP

**Action Required**:
1. Add "EC Data Sources" subsection mapping EC objects to ECP infotypes:
   - EC Higher Duty Assignment (MDF/Global Assignment) → IT0509
   - EC Time Off Request → IT2001
   - EC Pay Component (HDHR) → ECP Wage Type
2. Include EC configuration prerequisites (pay component groups, allowance calculation method)
3. Clarify that IT tables accessed during payroll run represent replicated EC data

#### **3. Architectural Justification for Custom Operation**
**Status**: Valid Concern Requiring Justification
**Evidence**: The feedback challenges whether a custom ZHDL operation is necessary given:
- IT0509 natively supports higher duty assignments with rate storage
- Standard ECP schema processes absence infotypes (IT2001) and applies rates
- SAP documentation shows standard HD allowance calculation in ECP

**However**, your design addresses a **non-standard requirement**: paying leave at HD rate **after** the HD period ends (when leave immediately follows). Standard functionality pays HD rate only **during** the active HD period.

**Action Required**:
1. Add explicit section: "Justification for Custom Enhancement"
   - Clearly state: "Standard ECP pays HD rate only during active IT0509 periods. DoE requires continuation of HD rate for eligible leaves taken immediately after HD ends, which is not standard behavior"
   - Reference that standard schema would revert to substantive rate once IT0509 end date passes
2. Consider hybrid approach: Could standard schema be extended via Personnel Calculation Rule (PCR) rather than full custom operation?
3. Document why BTP extension was rejected (if evaluated) - although for payroll rate logic, schema operations are appropriate

***

### **NON-GAPS - Adequately Addressed or Misunderstood**

#### **4. Teacher Scenario Coverage**
**Status**: Not a Gap
**Evidence**: Your specification includes:
- Section 2.4 Example Case 2 specifically addresses teachers, summer vacation, and 24-day payment at HD rate
- Section 2.2 Key Rules mentions school vacation processing with reference to work schedules
- Logic flow (section 2.3) includes checking for school vacation periods using PERWS and employee work schedule

**Clarification**: While you could add more examples (7-week vs. 6-week schools, full-year HD scenarios), the core logic framework handles these through the work schedule and gap analysis already specified. The feedback acknowledges this is "Partially Covered."

**Optional Enhancement**: Add subsection "School-Specific Variations" with configuration notes for different vacation calendars, but this is refinement rather than gap closure.

#### **5. Use of ECP Technical Constructs**
**Status**: Not a Gap - Design Choice Appropriate for ECP Context
**Evidence**:
- Your specification is explicitly titled "E026 – HD Leave Payments" in **Employee Central Payroll (ECP)**
- ECP is built on SAP HCM payroll engine, which uses infotypes, wage types, and ABAP schema
- Standard ECP documentation uses identical terminology (IT0509, IT2001, PCRs, wage types)

**Justification**: The feedback states "the spec can retain SAP terms but should also describe the EC perspective" - which aligns with Gap #2 above (add EC mapping), not eliminate ECP terminology.

**Action**: Per Gap #2, add EC-to-ECP mapping section. Retain all ECP technical details as they are correct for the payroll processing layer.

#### **6. Concurrent Employment Handling**
**Status**: Not a Gap
**Evidence**: Your section 2.6 explicitly states: "The HD is at assignment level and the operation will process each assignment separately."

This aligns with standard HD implementation where IT0509 is stored against the substantive personnel number (PERNR) with multiple HD records possible. No additional detail required beyond what you've provided.

***

### **CRITICAL ADDITIONS REQUIRED**

Based on research, add these sections to strengthen your specification:

#### **A. Prerequisites and Dependencies**
Document:
1. EC Higher Duty configuration must be complete (Provisioning enabled, pay component groups defined)
2. P2P integration must include IT0509 replication with Australia filter (country 13)
3. Wage type HDEA (EC Higher Duty Est Allow) must be mapped
4. Work schedules must reflect school calendars for teacher positions

#### **B. EC-ECP Data Flow Diagram**
Add visual/textual flow:
```
EC Higher Duty Assignment Created
  → Triggers P2P replication
  → BAdI HRSFEC_B_CE_CHANGE_IT0509 populates IT0509[web:11]
  → HD Rate Pay Component → Wage Type (HDHR)
  → During Payroll Run:
     - Standard schema applies HD rate while IT0509 active
     - Custom ZHDL operation extends rate to post-HD leave
```

#### **C. Standard vs. Custom Processing Boundary**
Clarify:
- Standard ECP processes HD during active period (IT0509 BEGDA to ENDDA)
- Custom ZHDL handles post-period leave continuation (DoE-specific rule)
- Standard absence valuation (IT2001) occurs first; ZHDL adjusts rate afterward

#### **D. Wage Type Configuration Requirements**
Specify required wage type attributes for WT9001:
- Processing class settings (refer V_512W_D, V_512W_O configuration)
- Cumulation settings in V_T54C3
- Statement wage type mappings

***

### **VALIDATION TASKS - TODO List**

1. **Document EC Pay Component to IT0509 Field Mapping**
   - Identify which IT0509 field stores HD hourly rate (HRATE? Custom field?)
   - Map EC pay component HDHR to specific IT0509 subtype/field
   - Verify via SAP table HRSFEC_PTP_0509 or equivalent mapping table

2. **Clarify BAdI Usage**
   - Confirm if BAdI HRSFEC_B_CE_CHANGE_IT0509 requires implementation
   - Document any data transformation logic needed during replication

3. **Test Standard Schema Behavior**
   - Create test case: HD ends Dec 10, leave starts Dec 11
   - Verify standard schema pays leave at substantive rate (confirming need for custom logic)
   - Document schema point where ZHDL must be inserted

4. **Define Wage Type 9001 Attributes**
   - Complete wage type configuration specification
   - Ensure it persists across pay periods (for continuous leave scenario in section 2.3)

5. **School Calendar Integration**
   - Document how school calendars are maintained (Public Holiday Calendar? Work Schedule variant?)
   - Specify logic to identify 6-week vs. 7-week schools (employee attribute? Position attribute?)

6. **Validate Retro Scenario**
   - Test: HD rate increases during leave period (your section 2.5 mentions this)
   - Confirm how retro accounting handles base rate change while WT9001 active
   - Consider PCR for retro adjustment class (83)

***

### **SUMMARY ASSESSMENT**

**Valid Gaps Requiring Action**: 3 (Items #1, #2, #3)
**Non-Gaps/Design Justifications**: 3 (Items #4, #5, #6)

**Priority Actions**:
1. **HIGH**: Add EC data model mapping section (addresses feedback items #2 and #4)
2. **HIGH**: Add architectural justification for custom operation vs. standard (addresses #1)
3. **MEDIUM**: Expand integration flow documentation with replication details (addresses #4)
4. **LOW**: Add supplementary teacher scenario examples (refinement, not gap)

Your core technical design (ZHDL operation logic, wage type usage, gap analysis via PERWS) is architecturally sound. The feedback primarily identifies **documentation gaps** in explaining the EC-to-ECP boundary and justifying the custom approach, rather than fundamental technical errors in your payroll processing logic.

The specification demonstrates strong understanding of ECP payroll mechanics (IT/OT/LRT table usage, schema processing, retroactive handling). Addressing the EC integration documentation will make this production-ready.

# CRITIQUE OF E026 HIGHER DUTIES LEAVE PAYMENT SPECIFICATION

## ACCURACY ASSESSMENT

### **Critical Factual Inconsistencies**

**1. Integration Architecture Misalignment**
- Your specification assumes traditional SAP ERP integration patterns, but SuccessFactors ECP operates differently in cloud environment
- **Issue**: The ZHDL custom operation approach conflicts with SuccessFactors' cloud-native payroll architecture, which emphasizes configuration over customization
- **Reality Check**: SuccessFactors ECP typically uses MDF objects and standard infotypes with configuration-based extensions rather than custom operations

**2. Data Flow Assumptions**
- You've assumed EC-ECP integration works like traditional SAP ECC-HR to Payroll, but SuccessFactors uses different replication mechanisms
- **Issue**: The IT0509 Higher Duties processing may not translate directly to SuccessFactors cloud architecture
- **Real Impact**: This could lead to fundamental data model mismatches requiring significant re-architecture

**3. Authentication and Security Model**
- Your OAuth 2.0 and TLS 1.3 references are correct but lack cloud-specific implementation details
- **Issue**: SuccessFactors uses X.509 certificates and specific API authentication patterns not covered in your analysis

## COMPLETENESS GAPS

### **Missing Cloud-Specific Considerations**

**1. SuccessFactors Business Rules**
- No mention of SuccessFactors Business Rules Engine for Higher Duties logic
- Missing consideration of MDF (Manage Data Framework) objects for custom Higher Duties configurations
- No reference to SuccessFactors-specific workflow capabilities

================================================================================
Task 6
================================================================================
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the HCMS Higher Duties Leave Payment (E026) specification and the feedback provided, here are deeper, clarifying questions that address gaps and expand the discussion:

## **EC-ECP Integration Architecture Questions**

1. **How does the SuccessFactors Integration Center handle the real-time synchronization of Higher Duties assignment changes when an employee's substantive role receives a pay increase during an active Higher Duties period?** The specification mentions business-as-usual changes like EBA pay increases, but doesn't address the integration complexity when both substantive and acting positions have concurrent rate changes.

2. **What specific error handling mechanisms exist in the EC-ECP data replication when there are conflicts between concurrent Higher Duties assignments and time-off requests being processed simultaneously in different systems?** This could create race conditions where the leave processing uses outdated rate information.

3. **How does the system handle the scenario where a Higher Duties assignment is retroactively modified after the leave period has already been processed and paid?** The current design focuses on forward-looking calculations but doesn't address retroactive adjustments across system boundaries.

## **SuccessFactors Cloud Architecture Questions**

4. **What are the specific performance implications of executing the ZHDL custom operation for thousands of Queensland teachers during peak leave periods, and how does this align with SuccessFactors' multi-tenant resource allocation?** The cloud environment has different performance constraints than on-premise systems.

5. **How does the SuccessFactors Business Rules Engine integrate with the custom ZHDL operation to ensure business logic consistency, and what happens when quarterly SuccessFactors updates modify the underlying calculation framework?** This addresses upgrade compatibility concerns.

6. **What SuccessFactors-specific monitoring and alerting capabilities are available to track the ZHDL operation's performance and accuracy, and how do these integrate with the broader HCMS monitoring strategy using Microsoft Sentinel?**

## **DoE-Specific Business Logic Questions**

7. **How does the system handle the complex scenario where a teacher performs Higher Duties across multiple school terms with different vacation schedules, and the leave period spans multiple academic years with different pay scales?** This goes beyond the simple summer vacation case to address complex assignment patterns.

8. **What happens when an employee on Higher Duties leave transitions to a different award classification (with different leave entitlements) while still maintaining the Higher Duties rate for the existing leave?** The specification addresses rate continuation but not classification changes.

9. **How does the system handle partial FTE Higher Duties assignments where the leave entitlements and pay rates need to be prorated differently than the standard full-time scenarios described?** The current examples assume full-time positions.

## **Data Governance and Compliance Questions**

10. **What specific data residency and sovereignty measures ensure that Higher Duties rate information and leave calculations remain within Australian data centers, particularly given the sensitive nature of compensation data?** This addresses the Queensland Government's data sovereignty requirements.

11. **How does the audit trail mechanism track every decision point in the Higher Duties leave rate application, including the gap analysis and working day determinations, to meet Queensland Government compliance requirements?** This is critical for payroll audits.

12. **What data retention policies apply to the temporary wage type (WT9001) and how does this align with Queensland's long-term payroll record-keeping requirements?** The specification creates temporary data structures but doesn't address their lifecycle.

## **Operational Resilience Questions**

13. **How does the system handle network connectivity issues between EC and ECP during payroll processing, particularly for schools in remote Queensland locations with limited internet access?** This addresses the operational reality of Queensland's geography.

14. **What fallback procedures exist when the custom ZHDL operation fails during payroll run, and how does this impact the broader payroll processing schedule for 100,000+ DoE employees?** This addresses critical system reliability concerns.

15. **How does the system manage concurrent processing when multiple payroll administrators are handling Higher Duties changes while the system is simultaneously processing leave payments?** This addresses user concurrency and system load management.

## **Change Management and Maintenance Questions**
