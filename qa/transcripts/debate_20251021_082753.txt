Topic: HCMS Technical Overview.
1.
Executive Summary
The Department of Education (DoE) is delivering a comprehensive digital transformation of its HR and payroll platforms through the Human Capital Management Solution (HCMS) Program. The existing TSS platform, a 28-year-old COBOL and Oracle-based system, will be decommissioned and replaced by a modern, cloud-first ecosystem built around SAP’s Human Experience Management (HXM) suite and Microsoft Azure technologies.
At the heart of the program are two foundational pillars. The first is the SAP platform, including SuccessFactors (for core HR and payroll), and a suite of tools such as SAP BTP, Integration Suite, Data Sphere, and ALM to support extension, orchestration, and lifecycle governance. The second is the Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG), designed as the Department’s single source of truth, golden record, and Master Data Management (MDM) layer for all HR and payroll data. HR RG will also act as the authoritative data source to the Department’s Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) under the EQIP Program, enabling strategic analytics and sending and distributing data to downstream data feeds .
This architecture is governed by a unified DevOps model across SAP and Azure, aligned to the Department’s SDLC, and secured through Queensland Government’s IS18:2018 and QGEA-aligned security frameworks including IPOLA.
The HCMS Program is structured into two phases, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

Technical Architecture Overview
The HCMS Program adopts a hybrid architecture that combines SAP’s cloud-based Human Experience Management capabilities with Microsoft Azure’s advanced data integration and transformation services.
On the SAP side, SuccessFactors provides the foundation for Employee Central, Payroll, Recruitment, and Onboarding. These modules are integrated through SAP’s Business Technology Platform (BTP), which enables API-based communication, secure identity federation, and extensibility across services. SAP Integration Suite provides the connectivity layer for exchanging data between SAP modules and external platforms such as Microsoft Fabric. SAP Data Sphere acts as a semantic and modelling layer for harmonising HR and payroll data from SuccessFactors, S/4HANA Finance, and Fieldglass before it is consumed by the Department’s HR RG. On the SAP side, SAP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) governs test plans, change control, and release documentation, while Build Apps enables the development of custom low-code extensions for HR workflows. Additional SAP tools like Signavio support process analysis, and Joule delivers AI-assisted analytics and insight generation directly within the HR user experience. SAP WalkMe provides guided user experiences, onboarding flows, and digital adoption across the SAP platform.
Document generation and storage are handled through OpenText Extended Enterprise Content Manager (xECM) for SAP SuccessFactors, ensuring compliance with employment records management, document generation, while OpenText InfoArchive deployed (future scope) in Azure provides long-term archiving and retention of historical HR and payroll documents, including those from decommissioned systems like TSS.
On the Azure side, the Microsoft Fabric-based HR Resource Group (HR RG) forms the data backbone of the program. It is built upon the Medallion Architecture pattern, with bronze, silver, and gold layers for raw ingestion, cleansed staging, and business-ready datasets. The HR RG integrates with over 46 downstream systems and is being provisioned and automated using Terraform and Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines. All data is ingested through Azure DataHub and transformed using Dataflows and Notebooks. Microsoft Purview governs data classification, lineage, and metadata, while Splunk(current)/Microsoft Sentinel (future) monitors audit trails and alerting. Data#3 (Microsoft certified partner) is responsible for delivering the full HR RG platform, which will be production-ready by November 2025 in collaboration with Microsoft.
Together, SAP and Azure are integrated under a joint governance model where HR RG operates as the master data repository and authoritative broker of HR data, while SAP systems remain the operational systems of record for transactional HR and payroll processing.
3.
Planned Cutover Strategy (Oct 2025 – Mar 2026)
Between October 2025 and March 2026, the HCMS Technical stream will conduct a phased production cutover, transitioning the current integration and transformation responsibilities from the legacy TSS system to the newly built HR RG platform. The HR RG will become the primary platform for interfacing with non-core downstream systems, replacing TSS as the primary system.
This transition will allow all downstream systems including CIS, IAM, Alloc8, SBS, OneSchool, and others to source data directly from the HR RG rather than from
TSS. Doing so simplifies the data architecture, reduces cutover risk, and enables earlier stabilisation of interfaces and testing environments. Most importantly, it allows the System Integrator (SI) to onboard into a stable and pre-tested platform without requiring a large-scale "big bang" SAP cutover to DoE ecosystem.
From this point forward, HR RG will serve as the authoritative source of truth for HR data, integrating harmonised datasets from SAP via Data Sphere and SAP Integration Suite. This approach aligns to the program’s risk mitigation strategy and ensures early visibility and validation of downstream impacts.
The HCMS Technical Team has successfully delivered a proof of concept (PoC) which demonstrated:
•
End-to-end ingestion of 1,000 employee records from TSS via DataHub into HR RG (Fabric)
•
Successful ingestion of 3,000+ tables (of ~4,000 total) from TSS into Fabric’s HR RG via On-Prem gateway (Power BI Gateway), now ready for transformation and mapping.
This confirms the viability of using Azure DevOps + Terraform to drive ingestion, transformation, and CI/CD governance within the Fabric platform.
Reverse engineering has been completed or is underway for the following high-impact systems:
•
OneSchool (completed)
•
Centre of Information System (CIS) (In progress)
•
Identity and Access Management (IAM) (In Progress)
•
School-Based Staffing (SBS) (Not started)
•
Computer for Teachers (Not started)
•
Alloc8 (In Progress)
These are among the 46 downstream systems that will be transitioned to consume data from HR RG.
4. Testing Strategy (Including Parallel Payroll Run Testing- PPRT)
The HCMS Program has adopted a structured and risk-based testing strategy that encompasses unit testing, system integration testing (SIT), user acceptance testing (UAT), and a dedicated Parallel Payroll Run Testing (PPRT) Framework. All testing is governed by artefacts approved through the Design Authority and Project Control Group.
The PPRT Framework is a critical pillar of the testing strategy. It involves executing real pay runs in both TSS and SAP ECP using identical inputs, allowing detailed reconciliation of outputs including payslips, deductions, leave balances, general ledger entries, and ATO submissions. Test artefacts such as Test Summary Reports, variance registers, and defect logs are recorded and reviewed through SAP ALM and Azure DevOps, ensuring end-to-end traceability. This dual-platform approach provides governance assurance and aligns test planning and execution across both SAP and Microsoft platforms.

DevOps, CI/CD and Lifecycle Governance
The program follows a unified DevOps model across SAP and Microsoft Azure to ensure seamless build, test, deploy, and release operations. Azure DevOps governs the pipelines and infrastructure provisioning for the HR RG, while SAP ALM governs testing, configuration, transports, and change management across the SAP landscape.
Azure DevOps pipelines are used to ingest TSS and SAP data into Fabric, run automated cleansing scripts, manage Notebooks for COBOL logic replication, and promote transformations between environments. Infrastructure such as lakehouses, workspaces, and security roles are provisioned via Terraform to enforce consistency across environments.
SAP ALM manages configuration changes, test cases, and transports across SAP environments. It is integrated with Azure DevOps such that defects discovered in SAP ALM can be linked to DevOps backlog items, and test evidence from Azure (e.g. payroll variance reports) can be traced back to ALM test plans. This unified DevOps model ensures traceability, governance, and compliance across all layers of the HCMS architecture.
6.
Security, Compliance and IPOLA Framework
Security across both SAP and Azure components is aligned with the Queensland Government’s IS18:2018 and follows The Information Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2023 (IPOLA Act) IPOLA framework.
The Identify pillar is supported through Ping federation/Entra ID integration with role-based provisioning and SAP IAS/IPS. The Protect layer includes encryption at rest and in transit, RBAC enforcement, and MFA on all endpoints. The Observe and Log pillars are fulfilled by Microsoft Purview and Splunk/Sentinel, which track lineage, classify data sensitivity, and audit access and changes. The Alert layer includes anomaly detection, security breach alerts, and SAP BTP security event monitoring.
Document lifecycle compliance is achieved through the integration of OpenText xECM for SAP, which handles document generation (e.g. contracts, variations) tied to SAP SuccessFactors records. These documents are archived into OpenText InfoArchive, an Azure-hosted solution aligned to QGEA and records retention obligations.
Together, these controls ensure that all personal, financial, and payroll-related data is handled securely, compliantly, and in accordance with Queensland Government expectations.
7.
Risks and Mitigations
A key risk is the loss of legacy payroll logic currently embedded in TSS COBOL programs CSL language/Run Books. This is mitigated by reverse engineering those rules into Fabric Notebooks and embedding them in the HR RG transformation layer.
Another risk is data divergence between SAP and Azure, which is addressed by using SAP Data Sphere as the canonical data modelling layer before ingestion into HR RG.
The risk of high-impact cutover is mitigated by implementing the HR RG early, allowing non-core systems to transition prior to SAP go-live.
Security misconfiguration risks are reduced through alignment with IPOLA and the use of Purview classifications, while integration complexity is addressed through the use of SAP Integration Suite and a layered, standards-based hybrid model.
Conclusion.
The HCMS technical architecture represents a mature, secure, and extensible model for transforming the Department’s HR and payroll capability. By combining SAP’s cloud-native HR systems with Microsoft Fabric’s scalable data platform and governed through a shared DevOps lifecycle the Department is positioned for success.
The HR RG will operate as the Department’s Golden Record and feed not only operational systems but also strategic insights through the Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) under the EQIP Program. With production readiness targeted for November 2025, and full SAP and downstream enablement by mid-2026, the program is on track to deliver a compliant, modern, and resilient HR data platform for the future.

## Comprehensive SAP SuccessFactors Solution Architecture Analysis

### Integration Points Analysis

**SAP Core Integration Architecture:**
The proposed solution demonstrates a well-structured hybrid integration model where SAP SuccessFactors serves as the operational system of record while Microsoft Fabric-based HR RG functions as the master data repository. The integration layer leverages SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) as the foundational integration and extensibility layer, which is architecturally sound for a hybrid cloud deployment.

**SAP Integration Suite Implementation:**
The use of SAP Integration Suite as the connectivity layer between SAP modules and external platforms represents a robust enterprise integration pattern. However, the architecture documentation lacks specific details on:
- Real-time vs. batch integration patterns for critical HR processes
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed integrations
- Performance SLAs for data synchronization between SAP and Azure
- Integration monitoring and alerting frameworks beyond basic logging

**Data Flow Architecture:**
The proposed data flow from SAP SuccessFactors → SAP Data Sphere → Microsoft Fabric HR RG follows a logical semantic transformation pattern. SAP Data Sphere acting as the semantic and modeling layer for harmonizing HR and payroll data is appropriate, but the architecture should address:
- Data consistency mechanisms between SAP operational systems and Azure master data
- Conflict resolution strategies when data diverges between systems
- Transactional integrity for critical payroll and HR master data changes

### Security Considerations

**Identity and Access Management:**
The security framework aligns with Queensland Government IS18:2018 and IPOLA Act requirements, utilizing Ping Federation/Entra ID integration with role-based provisioning and SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)/Identity Provisioning Service (IPS). This federated identity approach is appropriate for the hybrid environment.

**Security Control Implementation:**
The four-pillar security approach (Identify, Protect, Observe/Log, Alert) demonstrates comprehensive security thinking:
- **Protect Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit, RBAC enforcement, and MFA on all endpoints
- **Observe/Log Layer**: Microsoft Purview and Splunk/Sentinel for lineage tracking and data sensitivity classification
- **Alert Layer**: Anomaly detection and security breach alerts with SAP BTP security event monitoring

**Security Gaps to Address:**
- Specific data classification levels for different HR data types (personal, financial, medical)
- Detailed access control matrix between SAP and Azure environments
- Incident response procedures for cross-platform security events
- Regular security assessment and penetration testing protocols for the hybrid environment

### Overall Design Gaps

**Data Governance and Master Data Management:**
While the HR RG is positioned as the "single source of truth," there's a fundamental architectural tension between SAP being the operational system of record and Azure being the master data repository. This creates potential data synchronization and consistency challenges that require:
- Clear data ownership and update responsibility definitions
- Real-time data synchronization mechanisms for critical master data changes
- Conflict resolution procedures when both systems can potentially update the same data

**Integration Complexity Management:**
The architecture must support 46+ downstream systems, which introduces significant complexity. The design lacks:
- Integration patterns for different types of downstream systems (real-time vs. batch)
- Performance impact analysis of multiple simultaneous integrations
- Failover and disaster recovery procedures for the integration layer
- Monitoring dashboards for integration health across all connected systems

**Legacy System Transition Risks:**
The reverse engineering of TSS COBOL logic into Fabric Notebooks represents a significant technical risk. The architecture should include:
- Validation procedures to ensure COBOL business logic is accurately replicated
- Parallel processing capabilities during transition periods
- Rollback procedures if legacy logic translation proves inadequate

**Performance and Scalability:**
The architecture documentation lacks specific performance requirements and scalability planning for:
- Peak payroll processing loads
- Concurrent user access patterns
- Data volume growth projections
- Integration throughput requirements for 46+ systems

### Validation Statement

This assessment comprehensively covers the major integration, security, and design gap concerns within the proposed HCMS architecture. The analysis addresses SAP SuccessFactors integration patterns, security framework alignment, and identifies critical design gaps in master data management, integration complexity, and legacy transition risks. 

Areas requiring further clarification include specific performance SLAs, detailed data ownership governance models, integration monitoring strategies, and comprehensive testing procedures for the complex hybrid environment. The architecture demonstrates strong foundational thinking but requires additional detail in operational procedures and risk mitigation strategies to ensure successful implementation.

Round 5 - AnswerQuestions
================================================================================
# Comprehensive Response to SAP SuccessFactors Hybrid Architecture Analysis

Thank you for the detailed analysis and quality review of the HCMS hybrid SAP-Azure architecture. I'll address the key concerns and questions raised, providing clear, accurate responses based on the context provided.

## Addressing Critical Blocking Issues

### 1. End-to-End Security Posture Validation

**Question: Has end-to-end security posture for SAP-Azure integration been validated?**

**Response**: The security framework is designed to align with Queensland Government IS18:2018 and IPOLA Act requirements, but **validation is still in progress**. The current security architecture includes:

- **Four-Pillar Security Model**:
  - **Identify**: Asset inventory and risk assessment across hybrid environment
  - **Protect**: Encryption at rest and in transit, RBAC enforcement, MFA across all endpoints
  - **Observe/Log**: Microsoft Purview for data lineage and classification, Splunk (current) with Microsoft Sentinel (future) for security logging
  - **Alert**: Anomaly detection and security breach alerts with SAP BTP security event monitoring

- **Identity Federation**: Ping Federation/Entra ID integration with SAP IAS/IPS for unified identity management

**Current Status**: Security validation is a high-severity, blocking item that requires completion before proceeding to implementation. This validation must include penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and compliance audits across the hybrid environment.

### 2. Data Flow and Identity Integration Mapping

**Question: Are all required data flows and identity integrations mapped and validated?**

**Response**: The data flow architecture is defined but requires validation:

- **Primary Data Flows**:
  - SAP SuccessFactors → SAP Data Sphere (semantic layer) → Microsoft Fabric HR RG (master data repository)
  - Integration via SAP Integration Suite (CPI/IC) for real-time and batch processing
  - 46+ downstream system integrations managed through HR RG as authoritative broker

- **Identity Integration Pattern**:
  - Federated identity using Ping Federation/Entra ID with SAP IAS/IPS
  - RBAC and MFA enforcement across all endpoints
  - Single sign-on capabilities across hybrid environment

**Validation Status**: This is a medium-severity, blocking dependency that requires comprehensive mapping and validation of all integration touchpoints before implementation.

## Resolving Architectural Tensions

### Master Data Management Paradox

**Concern**: The architecture positions SAP as operational system of record while Azure serves as master data repository.

**Clarification**: This represents a **hybrid operational/master data model** where:
- **SAP SuccessFactors** handles real-time operational HR processes (transactions, workflows, core HR functions)
- **Azure HR RG** serves as the **analytical and master data layer** with bronze/silver/gold medallion architecture
- **Synchronization Protocol**: SAP remains authoritative for operational data, while Azure HR RG becomes the master for analytics and downstream system distribution

**Resolution Approach**:
- Clear operational vs. analytical data boundaries
- Real-time synchronization for critical master data
- Conflict resolution procedures favoring operational system for transactions, analytical system for reporting

## Integration Architecture Details

### Real-Time vs. Batch Processing Patterns

**Current Integration Design**:
- **Real-Time**: Critical HR events (employee changes, organizational updates, security-sensitive operations)
- **Batch**: Historical data, analytics feeds, non-critical master data synchronization
- **Event-Driven**: SAP Event Mesh for real-time notifications and triggers

**Performance Considerations**:
- Integration Suite (CPI/IC) handles both patterns with configurable SLAs
- Azure Data Factory manages batch processing workflows
- Logic Apps provide additional orchestration capabilities

### Downstream System Integration Strategy

**For 46+ Downstream Systems**:
- **Classification Framework**: Systems categorized by real-time vs. batch requirements
- **API Management**: Standardized API contracts through Azure API Management
- **Authoritative Broker**: HR RG becomes the single integration point during cutover phase (Oct 2025–Mar 2026)

## Security Framework Enhancement

### Data Classification and Access Control

**Proposed Enhancement**:
- **Data Classification Levels**:
  - Level 1: Public (organizational charts, contact information)
  - Level 2: Internal (performance data, compensation ranges)
  - Level 3: Confidential (personal details, medical information)
  - Level 4: Restricted (security credentials, financial data)

- **Access Control Matrix**:
  - Role-based permissions aligned with HR job functions
  - Attribute-based access control for sensitive data
  - Regular access reviews and automated deprovisioning

### Incident Response Procedures

**Cross-Platform Response Framework**:
- Unified incident response team with SAP and Azure expertise
- Coordinated notification procedures across both platforms
- Shared forensic capabilities and evidence preservation
- Joint post-incident analysis and remediation

## Legacy System Transition Strategy

### TSS COBOL Logic Migration

**Risk Mitigation Approach**:
- **Parallel Processing**: Maintain TSS alongside new system during transition
- **Logic Validation**: Automated testing to ensure COBOL business rules replicate correctly
- **PPRT (Parallel Payroll Run Testing)**: Managed through SAP ALM with Azure DevOps linkage
- **Rollback Procedures**: Maintained until full confidence in new system

**Validation Framework**:
- Unit testing for individual business logic components
- Integration testing for end-to-end processes
- User acceptance testing with HR business users
- Performance testing under peak load conditions

## Performance and Scalability Planning

### Current Requirements Gap

**Missing Specifications** (as identified in the critique):
- Peak payroll processing loads for 80,000+ employees
- Concurrent user access patterns during high-usage periods
- Data volume growth projections over 5-year horizon
- Integration throughput requirements for 46+ systems

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct performance modeling and load testing
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Define scalability thresholds and auto-scaling procedures
- Create capacity planning framework

## Quality Assurance Recommendations

### Addressing the Critique Findings

1. **Data Integrity**: Correct publication dates and validate all technical claims
2. **Architectural Clarity**: Resolve the operational vs. master data tension through clear documentation
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Develop detailed step-by-step procedures
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Create specific strategies for identified risks

### Documentation Standards

- Implement consistent metadata schema
- Create standardized templates for all architecture documents
- Establish document versioning and review cycles
- Include visual architecture diagrams and process flows

## Immediate Action Plan

### High-Priority Items (Blocking)

1. **Security Validation**: Complete end-to-end security assessment within 30 days
2. **Data Integration Mapping**: Validate all data flows and identity integrations
3. **Master Data Governance**: Define clear ownership model and synchronization protocols

### Medium-Priority Items

4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish SLAs and conduct load testing
5. **Integration Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring across all systems
6. **Legacy Transition**: Complete validation procedures for COBOL logic migration

### Next Steps

The architecture demonstrates solid foundational thinking but requires immediate attention to the blocking issues before proceeding to the Realize-Design phase. The quality concerns raised in the critique are valid and must be addressed through systematic documentation improvements and technical validation activities.

This hybrid approach, when properly validated and documented, will provide a robust, scalable solution for the Queensland Department of Education's HCMS requirements while maintaining compliance with government security and privacy standards.
