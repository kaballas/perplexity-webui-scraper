Topic: Based on the HCMS Technical Overview, the key components of the Department of Education's new platform are structured around two foundational pillars: the SAP platform and the Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG).
SAP platform
SAP SuccessFactors: Provides the foundation for core HR functions, including Employee Central, Payroll, Recruitment, and Onboarding.
SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP): Enables API-based communication, identity federation, and extensibility for the SAP modules.
SAP Integration Suite: The connectivity layer for exchanging data between SAP components and other platforms like Microsoft Fabric.
SAP Data Sphere: A semantic and modeling layer that harmonizes HR and payroll data from various SAP sources before it is sent to the HR RG.
SAP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management): Governs testing, change control, and release documentation for the SAP components.
SAP Build Apps: Used for developing custom, low-code extensions for HR workflows.
OpenText Extended Enterprise Content Manager (xECM) for SAP SuccessFactors: Manages document generation and storage for employment records.
OpenText InfoArchive: A future-scope component for long-term archiving of historical HR and payroll documents from decommissioned systems.
Joule: Delivers AI-assisted analytics and insights within the HR user experience.
Signavio: Supports process analysis.
SAP WalkMe: Provides guided user experiences, onboarding, and digital adoption.
Microsoft Azure technologies
Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG): The data backbone of the program, acting as the single source of truth, master data management (MDM) layer, and "golden record" for all HR and payroll data.
Medallion Architecture: The HR RG is built on this pattern, with bronze, silver, and gold layers for data ingestion, staging, and business-ready datasets.
Azure DataHub: Used for ingesting all data into the HR RG.
Dataflows and Notebooks: Used for data transformation within Fabric.
Terraform and Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines: Used for provisioning and automating the HR RG.
Microsoft Purview: Governs data classification, lineage, and metadata.
Microsoft Sentinel: The future monitoring solution for audit trails and alerting, replacing Splunk.
Power BI Gateway (On-Prem gateway): Facilitated the ingestion of data from the legacy TSS system into Fabric during the proof of concept phase.
Downstream systems
The HCMS will integrate with numerous downstream systems that will source HR data from the new HR RG, including:
CIS
IAM
Alloc8
SBS
OneSchool
