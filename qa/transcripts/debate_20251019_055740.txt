Round 1 - Todo

{
  "summary": "The conversation focused on developing a technical specification for the I000 Employee Master Data integration between SAP EC and SAP ECP for Queensland Department of Education. The discussion evolved from initial clarification questions about integration patterns to a comprehensive technical specification, with multiple rounds of critique identifying critical gaps in technical implementation details, compliance requirements, and architectural clarity. The integration was confirmed as a SuccessFactors-native PTP approach using Integration Center rather than external event-driven infrastructure.",
