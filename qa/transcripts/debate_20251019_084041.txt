Topic: BTP - HISTORIC DATA CONSIDERATIONS
The following is a high level consideration of the historic data required to be loaded in SuccessFactors to
adequately support the process post go-live:
ID # Description Data Required to Support Process
E001 Salary Increment At least 2 full school years of data is required for this
process, noting overrides will be available for edge cases.
E002a Teacher Vacation Payments At least 2 full school years of data is required for this
process, noting overrides will be available for edge cases.
E002b Teacher Aide Vacation Payments At least 2 full school years of data is required for this
process, noting overrides will be available for edge cases.
E003 Leave Balances (Including Concurrent
Assignments)
Aside from a cutover of leave balances (split by
assignment), no historic data is required. The ability to
manually adjust Time Accounts will exist by default.
E004 Leave Requests & Approvals - Concurrent Only current and future dated absences should be loaded
at cutover. Any pre go-live change will require a process to
adjust time account balances and leave payment id
applicable
E005 Sick Leave & LWOP - Automation of LWOP
when sick leave balance is not enough)
No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
E006 Work Schedule Search & Overview No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
E007 Employee Tax Details No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
E008 Employee Superannuation Details No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
E010 School Holiday Calendar / Pupil Free Days At least 2 full school years of data is required to support
Salary Increment and Vacation payments, therefore the
previous school calendars are required.
E011 BTP Fiori Form - EOI for Transfer for
Teachers/Teacher Aides + Transfer Points
calculation /reporting
At least 10 years history is required here to assist Principal
in making a decision on internal transfer. Some connection
to HR Resource Group will therefore be required.
E012 Auto payout of any public holidays
covered by LSL / Annual Leave balances
on
Termination
No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
Page | 245
E023 Auto creation of Net offset for
overpayments over threshold
No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
E024 Auto Time-Off payout on Voluntarily
termination
No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
E026 HD - Higher Rate when leave taken straight
after
No historic data as such is required, however the cutover
process will need to cater for ‘in-flight’ absences that need
to be paid at a pre go-live Higher Duties rate of pay.
E027 Casuals Time Sheet Extension for Multiple
Schools
No historic data is required to support this process post golive.
Noting, any pre go-live adjustment to Casual Hours will
need to be adjusted post go-live and paid accordingly.

# SAP SuccessFactors Metadata Extraction Report
## Historic Data Considerations Analysis

### Executive Summary
Based on the historic data requirements document, this metadata extraction focuses on identifying the core data objects, fields, and relationships necessary to support the Business Transformation Program (BTP) historic data loading requirements in SAP SuccessFactors.

### 1. Core Data Objects Metadata

#### 1.1 Employee Central (EC) Objects
- **EmploymentInfo** - Employment history and status tracking
  - Key Fields: employmentStatus, startDate, endDate, jobInfo changes
  - Temporal Management: Effective dating support for historical employment records
  - Required for: E001 (Salary Increment), E002a/b (Vacation Payments)

- **JobInfo** - Job assignment and position history
  - Key Fields: position, jobCode, employmentType, assignmentId
  - Temporal Management: Date-effective job changes
  - Required for: E003 (Leave Balances with Concurrent Assignments)

- **CompensationInfo** - Salary and compensation history
  - Key Fields: salary, payComponent, payDate, currencyCode
  - Temporal Management: Historical salary increments
  - Required for: E001 (Salary Increment), E002a/b (Vacation Payments)

#### 1.2 Time Off Management Objects

### 2. Time-Based Data Requirements

#### 2.1 Historical Data Retention Analysis
- **2-Year History Required** (E001, E002a/b, E010):
  - Salary increment history (CompensationInfo)
  - Vacation payment records (Payroll results)
  - School calendar definitions (Holiday calendars)

- **10-Year History Required** (E011):
  - Transfer history and points (Custom fields in EmploymentInfo)
  - Performance and evaluation records
  - Assignment history tracking

#### 2.2 Temporal Data Management
- **Effective Dating**: All employment-related objects support date-effective processing
- **Version Control**: Historical changes preserved with audit trails
- **Retroactive Processing**: Support for backdated changes with approval workflows

### 3. Integration Metadata

#### 3.1 API Endpoints for Historic Data Loading
