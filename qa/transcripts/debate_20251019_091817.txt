Topic: ## Optimization Strategies

### Organizational Structure Configuration

**Position Hierarchy Design:** Enable Position Management with concurrent employment tracking to maintain separate hierarchical structures independent from employee assignments. Configure hierarchy adoption switches to prevent circular reporting relationships where employees report to themselves—essential when department leads hold team positions within the same department. Maintain separate position hierarchy and person-to-person hierarchy structures to support complex reporting lines while preserving workflow routing integrity.

**Dynamic Group Segmentation:** Leverage Dynamic Groups within manage mass changes functionality to efficiently target concurrent employment populations using employee attributes. Create attribute-based groupings for employees holding cross-department roles, enabling bulk updates to compensation, organizational assignments, and job information without manual record-by-record processing.

**FTE Allocation Models:** Implement proportionate FTE and salary distribution across concurrent employments for granular cost tracking, or configure a leading assignment model where one employment holds all payroll-relevant data. The leading assignment approach reduces integration complexity with external payroll systems while maintaining position-level reporting accuracy.

### Workflow Configuration Best Practices

**Context-Based Approval Routing:** Configure workflow Context parameters to determine approvers based on Source (current manager) or Target (new manager) attributes. For cross-department role changes, implement two-step workflows capturing approvals from both source and target managers to ensure stakeholder accountability across organizational boundaries. When data changes don't involve manager transitions, the system automatically consolidates duplicate approval steps to the same individual.

**Role-Based Participation Design:** Define workflow participants across three distinct roles: Approvers (approve/reject/comment), Contributors (provide decision-supporting input), and CC Roles (receive completion notifications). For concurrent employment scenarios, assign department heads as Approvers, HR Business Partners as Contributors, and payroll administrators as CC Roles to maintain visibility without approval bottlenecks.

**Cross-System Workflow Integration:** Implement Cross-System Workflow for SAP SuccessFactors Solutions to streamline HR processes connecting SuccessFactors with SAP ERP HCM. Configure data change triggers on Job Information that initiate workflows even without native Employee Central workflow involvement, enabling automated cross-department approval routing for concurrent employment modifications.

**Termination Workflow Specialization:** Design termination workflows recognizing that concurrent employment follows Primary vs. Secondary employment logic rather than Global Assignment's Home vs. Host concept. Configure routing to Secondary Employment Manager first, followed by Primary Employment Dynamic Role, ensuring proper approval sequence when terminating future-dated concurrent positions.

### Technical Performance Optimization

**Centralized Services Architecture:** Enable Centralized Services for Job Information imports to deliver process and security enhancements for concurrent worker data. Centralized services provide default enablement for contingent workers with concurrent employment, though opt-out remains available via Company System and Logo Settings.

**Forward Propagation Configuration:** Activate forward propagation for contingent worker data to automatically calculate and update effective-dated employee records when adding new concurrent positions. This functionality cascades field value changes to future-dated records, reducing manual data maintenance overhead across multiple employment relationships.

**Mass Change Synchronization:** Configure position-side changes to synchronize back to employee records via reclassification when concurrent employment updates occur. Ensure Position Management integration with Employee Profile updates maintains data consistency across both employee-side and position-side concurrent employment modifications.

### Integration Architecture

**User Identity Management:** Address the complexity of multiple User IDs per person by implementing unified identity management systems that map a single Person ID to multiple User IDs. Design manager experience, HR process workflows, and permission configurations accounting for employees accessing different employment records under one username but with distinct employment-specific permissions.

**Payroll System Integration:** Configure replication of concurrent employments from Employee Central to SAP ERP payroll using localized payroll-specific settings and considerations. Implement transformation logic handling FTE splits, salary allocations, and cost center distributions based on the selected FTE allocation model (proportionate vs. leading assignment).

**Data Extraction Standards:** Follow SAP SuccessFactors Employee Data Integration best practices for extracting concurrent employment data to downstream reporting, analytics, and operational systems. Establish data consistency validation ensuring concurrent employment attributes propagate correctly across integrated platforms while maintaining referential integrity.

### Module-Specific Considerations

**Performance Management Impact:** Define system behavior for Performance and Goal Management modules when employees hold multiple concurrent positions. Configure whether both assignments receive separate performance forms or consolidate to primary employment only, balancing comprehensive evaluation against administrative efficiency. For Continuous Performance Management, document the impact of multiple employments on feedback cycles, goal alignment, and development planning processes.

**Compensation Planning Configuration:** Establish business rules determining whether concurrent employments participate independently in compensation planning or consolidate to primary employment. Configure merit increase calculations, bonus allocations, and equity awards accounting for split FTE scenarios or leading assignment models depending on organizational compensation philosophy.

**Talent Process Design:** Configure Recruiting and Succession Planning modules to leverage position-based talent processes supporting concurrent employment scenarios. Enable position objects as requisition sources for internal mobility programs where employees seek additional concurrent roles while maintaining primary employment.

## Implementation Best Practices

### Configuration Phasing

**Phase 1 - Foundation:** Enable concurrent employment functionality through Upgrade Center, recognizing feature irreversibility once activated. Configure basic organizational structure supporting multiple position assignments per employee, establishing position codes, cost centers, and reporting hierarchies.

**Phase 2 - Workflow Design:** Build role-based approval workflows incorporating Source/Target context routing, multi-step approvals for cross-department scenarios, and termination-specific logic addressing Primary/Secondary employment sequencing.

**Phase 3 - Integration:** Implement Cross-System Workflow connecting Employee Central concurrent employment changes with SAP ERP HCM, payroll systems, and downstream analytics platforms. Establish data extraction patterns following integration best practices for concurrent employment attributes.

**Phase 4 - Optimization:** Deploy mass change capabilities for concurrent employment population management, activate forward propagation for automated data maintenance, and configure Centralized Services for enhanced security and processing efficiency.

### Testing Strategy

**User Experience Validation:** Test employment switcher functionality enabling employees to toggle between concurrent positions from a single username. Verify intuitive navigation between primary and secondary employment contexts within Employee Profile, ensuring data segregation and appropriate field access.

**Workflow Routing Verification:** Validate approval routing correctly identifies Source and Target managers for cross-department role changes, consolidates duplicate approvers when organizational changes don't alter reporting lines, and properly sequences Primary/Secondary employment approvers during termination workflows.

**Integration Testing:** Execute end-to-end testing of concurrent employment data replication to SAP ERP payroll, confirming FTE calculations, salary distributions, and cost center allocations process correctly. Test Cross-System Workflow triggers for Job Information changes spanning SuccessFactors and ERP systems.

**Performance Impact Assessment:** Measure system response times for concurrent employment creation, employment switcher toggling, and mass change operations against established baselines. Validate that multiple User ID scenarios don't degrade manager experience, workflow routing performance, or permission evaluation speed.

### Governance Framework

**Data Quality Controls:** Establish organizational structure validation rules preventing circular reporting relationships through automated pre-save checks. Implement recurring audits identifying concurrent employment data anomalies including mismatched FTE totals, orphaned position assignments, and approval workflow routing failures.

**Change Management Protocols:** Document business rules governing FTE allocation methodology, payroll processing approach, and talent process participation for concurrent employees. Create decision frameworks determining when to suppress Performance Management forms, Compensation Planning eligibility, or Succession Planning visibility for secondary employments.

**Continuous Improvement:** Monitor workflow completion rates, approval cycle times, and termination processing accuracy specific to concurrent employment scenarios. Leverage employee feedback on switcher usability, manager feedback on approval clarity, and HR administrator feedback on mass change efficiency to drive iterative enhancements.
