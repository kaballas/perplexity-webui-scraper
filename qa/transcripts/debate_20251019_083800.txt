Topic: E026 – LEAVE RATE INCLUSIVE OF HIGHER DUTIES WHEN HD
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES ELIGIBLE ABSENCE
As per the Higher Duties directive, the payment of certain leave types during and immediately following a
period of Higher Duties are required to be paid inclusive of the higher rate:
Payment of higher duties amount during recreation leave, long service leave and paid
parental leave
An employee who takes recreation leave, long service leave or paid parental leave during a relieving
period is entitled to be paid for the full period of such leave at the higher duties amount being paid
to the employee immediately before the employee takes the leave. This will be the case even where
the relieving period ceases on the last day of duty prior to the leave commencing, or at any point
during the leave period
Current State
The functionality has been in-built in TSS and processes the following leave types
􀁸 Long Service Leave
􀁸 Paid Parental
􀁸 Annual / Recreation Leave
Future State - Out of The Box
EC Payroll will natively pay appropriate leave types inclusive of the Higher Duties rate where the leave is
taken during the relieving period, however an extension is required to maintain that higher rate even after
the higher duties has finished.
Enhancement Considerations
The enhancement needs to consider a number of factors to ensure compliance with the Higher Duties
directive.
Identify the end of the relieving period, noting this could fall in a previous pay period, as well as confirming
the Long Service Leave, Paid Parental (of which there could be multiple variants) and Annual / Recreation
Leave has started immediately following the period of higher duties has ended.
Furthermore, the processing must identify any scenarios where the leave and the period of higher duties
overlaps to ensure the remainder of the leave is continued to be paid at the higher rate.
Finally, the enhancement must be able to identify periods of consecutive leave that is not broken by either
a working day, or another leave type that does not attract the same entitlement (e.g. sick leave).
Enhancement Design
Employee Central Payroll
A payroll operation is required to be executed, triggered by the presence of an appropriate leave wage
type (e.g. Long Service Leave), to then determine whether a higher duties rate needs to be applied.
Page | 240
Given the pay period in question could be mid-way through the leave and/or completely outside of the
relieving period, the operation will query the preceding pay period to ascertain whether the higher rate is
applicable.
To reduce the payroll processing time as much as possible, the simplest way to achieve this is to have the
payroll operation generate a notional wage type to flag that eligible leave types have immediately
followed higher duties.
As such the enhancement design should consider:
􀍻 Eligible Leave
○ Determine the eligible leave type through a custom processing class setting against the leave
wage type. Using the processing class configuration negates the need to hard code the wage
types themselves and therefore future proofs the operation design for any change in policy.
○ Enhancement must consider consecutive periods of eligible leave
􀍻 Higher Duties and Personal Work Schedule
○ Once the leave is identified, determine the existence of higher duties and ensure no working
day, with direct reference to the employees’ personal work schedule, exists between the last
day of the relieving period.
􀍻 Higher Duties Rate of Pay
○ Determine the applicable hourly rate of pay to apply to the eligible leave type. There are a
number of ways to achieve this, the operation itself could derive the rate of pay of the higher
duties or similarly a notional pay component from EC could store the HD rate of pay.
○ Once determined the rate of pay of the HD is added to the employee’s normal rate of pay for
leave to achieve the higher rate.
○ The design should take account of business-as-usual changes in an employee’s rate of pay.
This could include a EBA pay increase against the substantive position, a retrospective pay
increase in the relieving position or the application of a new recurring allowance
