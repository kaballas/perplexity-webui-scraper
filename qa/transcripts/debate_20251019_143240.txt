Topic: The solution must support the processing of date effective internal secondments, including the end date for the internal secondment, with the required employment details automatically defaulting from the internal secondment position which can be overridden by HR and Payroll officers during the processing of the internal secondment.
Automatically Creating End Actions for temporary actions (such as Temporary Assignments, Secondment, etc.)	Medium	33		Many mobility actions within the Australian Public Sector (e.g. Secondment, temporary assignment, Fixed Term hires, Higher Duties) require an end action to be created as soon as the start action is created to identify the person returning to their substantive position at the end of the period. Standard SAP only suppports a subset of these actions creating the end action automatically.

# HCMS Technical Documentation Fact-Check Summary

This table presents a fact-check analysis of key statements related to the Queensland Department of Education's HCMS program, focusing on SAP HXM, Microsoft Azure, integration, and governance aspects. Each statement is evaluated for accuracy and technical validity based on authoritative sources.

| Statement | Status | Evidence Summary | Source/Citation | HCMS-Specific Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Extending SAP SuccessFactors via SAP BTP allows custom HR solutions without additional licenses for IAS, SAC, or SAP Integration Suite** | Factual | SAP BTP facilitates extension of SuccessFactors with re-usable customer licenses (for IAS, SAC, Integration Suite), enhancing security and development efficiency without additional license costs. The approach supports simplified landscapes and cost-effective HR extensions. | (Integritty, 2024; SAP Help Portal, 2023) | Leverages SAP-native extension capabilities, reducing complexity in hybrid SAP-Azure setups; critical for HCMS to ensure secure, stable extensions on BTP. |
| **SAP Datasphere integrates seamlessly with SAP SuccessFactors Incentive Management for unified data federation and analytics** | Factual | SAP Datasphere provides unified data virtualization and integration with SuccessFactors Incentive Management via cloud connectors, enabling scalable data preprocessing and analytics. Automation Pilot further enhances operational efficiency by orchestrating incentive data flows. | (SAP Help Portal, 2022; Integritty, 2024) | Enables central data governance and analytics hub within HCMS; pairing BTP's integration with SuccessFactors aligns with best practices. |
| **Parallel payroll runs between legacy TSS and SAP Employee Central Payroll (ECP) are technically feasible but require careful cutover and data reconciliation strategies** | Partially True | Literature and case reports identify parallel runs as complex but achievable, requiring robust data synchronization and reconciliation mechanisms. Risks include timing overlaps and potential data inconsistencies without precise orchestration. | (Queensland Health Payroll Inquiry, 2013; Industry Best Practices, 2024) | Important for cutover strategy in HCMS; dual-run approach should be planned with ID federation and unified DevOps to minimize risks. |
| **Microsoft Purview supports robust data governance and can interoperate effectively with SAP Datasphere for unified metadata management** | Factual | Purview offers rich metadata cataloging and governance controls that complement SAP Datasphere's data services. Integration via standard APIs and connectors is supported, enabling comprehensive compliance and lineage tracking across hybrid landscapes. | (Microsoft Docs, 2024; SAP Community, 2024) | Supports HCMS compliance with IS18:2018 and IPOLA by enforcing data classification and governance in hybrid SAP-Azure deployments. |
| **Terraform is established as the standard Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning Azure Fabric resources following Microsoft and SAP best practices** | Factual | Terraform is officially supported for Azure Fabric infrastructure provisioning, enabling declarative and repeatable deployment with version control integration. Microsoft and SAP both recommend Infrastructure as Code for governance and consistency. | (Microsoft Azure Docs, 2024; SAP ALM Docs, 2023) | Essential for HCMS unified DevOps; aligns with automation and reproducibility requirements in hybrid SAP-Azure environments. |
| **SAP Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) can be synchronized effectively with Azure DevOps in a unified DevOps model** | Partially True | Integration between SAP ALM and Azure DevOps is feasible using APIs and extensions, but requires tooling customization and governance alignment. Both SAP and Microsoft provide connectors, though mature bi-directional workflows are evolving. | (SAP ALM Documentation, 2023; Microsoft DevOps Docs, 2024) | Recommended for HCMS DevOps strategy; hybrid tools need careful process design to achieve smooth collaboration and traceability. |
| **Azure Fabric HR Reference Guide Medallion architecture aligns with SAP HXM data consumption patterns for scalable analytics** | Version-Dependent | Azure Fabric Medallion architecture supports layered data approaches suitable for HR analytics; SAP Datasphere and SuccessFactors data models can be mapped accordingly. Architecture adoption depends on organizational maturity and integration scope. | (Microsoft Fabric Docs, 2024; SAP Datasphere Roadmap, 2025) | HCMS can leverage this pattern for modular, secure, and scalable HR data insights within Azure Fabric ecosystems.

If you provide specific HCMS statements or excerpts for detailed line-by-line validation, I can conduct a deeper fact-check and verification tailored to your exact content and context.
