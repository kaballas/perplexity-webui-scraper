Round 1 - AskQuestions
================================================================================
As a curious inquirer examining the WRICEF for Data Migration of Positions, I have several clarifying questions that could deepen our understanding of this critical component:

**Scope and Boundaries:**
- What specific position data elements are included/excluded in the migration scope (e.g., historical position changes, position descriptions, reporting relationships, budget allocations, FTE calculations)?
- How do we handle positions that have undergone multiple changes or reorganizations over time - do we migrate current state only or include historical position hierarchies?

**Data Quality and Governance:**
- What are the data quality thresholds and validation rules that will determine if position data is "migration-ready" versus requiring cleanup first?
- How do we handle duplicate positions, orphaned records, or positions with incomplete/missing critical attributes in the source system?

**Integration Dependencies:**
- Since the debate summary mentioned unresolved integration dependencies, how does the position migration interface with employee data migration to ensure referential integrity?
- What downstream systems depend on position data that might be affected by the migration timeline and approach?

**Business Process Impact:**
- How will the position migration affect ongoing HR processes like recruitment, organizational planning, or budgeting during the transition period?
- What happens to active position-related workflows (approvals, changes) during the cutover window?

**Configuration and Customization:**
- Are there position-specific business rules or validations that need to be configured in the target system before migration can occur?
- How do we handle position types or categories that exist in the legacy system but may not have direct equivalents in the new system?

These questions could help surface assumptions and identify potential risks before moving to the Realize phase.

Round 3 - AskQuestions
================================================================================
As a curious inquirer examining the WRICEF for Data Migration of Positions, I have several clarifying questions that could deepen our understanding of this critical component:

**Data Harmonization and Historical Integrity:**
- Given the requirement to migrate "28 years of historical employee movement data" mentioned in the legacy data strategy, how does the position migration handle the temporal aspects where positions themselves may have changed titles, classifications, or reporting structures over nearly three decades? What specific date-effective migration sequencing will ensure employment history integrity while maintaining position data accuracy?

**Governance and Escalation Protocols:**
- The governance documents mention escalation protocols for migration-related data issues, but how do these specifically apply to position data conflicts during the phased migration approach? What decision-making authority exists when position hierarchies in legacy systems conflict with current organizational structures being implemented in SuccessFactors?

**Automated Validation Thresholds:**
- While automated validation processes are mentioned for data quality assurance, what specific reconciliation rules will validate position-to-employee relationships during migration? How will the system handle scenarios where a position exists in the source but no longer exists in the target organization, or where multiple legacy positions need to be consolidated?

**Resource Allocation and Troubleshooting:**
- The cutover plan requires confirmation of key personnel availability, but what specialized expertise is required specifically for position data validation during the cutover window? How does the troubleshooting guide address position-related issues that might affect payroll processing or organizational reporting immediately post-migration?

**Phased Migration Dependencies:**
- Since position management involves complex roles and the migration plan indicates various phases, what are the specific dependencies between position data migration and other HR data migrations (employee, organizational, compensation) that could create bottlenecks or require parallel processing?

**Master Data Management Integration:**
- How does the position migration strategy integrate with the broader master data management approach, particularly when dealing with positions that have multiple incumbents over time or positions that are currently vacant but need to be preserved in the new system?

These deeper questions could help surface the operational complexities that might not be immediately apparent in the strategic planning documents.
