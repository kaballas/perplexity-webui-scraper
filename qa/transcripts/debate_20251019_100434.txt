This is happening after the 2H Preview release.

Environment
SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding

Cause
This issue will only occur if there is a dependency on DG Filters used in External User Role Based Permission Groups.
This was caused due to a regression after the 2H 2025 Release
Resolution
Product Engineering has fixed the issue.
All the newly initiated candidates from RCM/Manual Onboarding are successfully available in the dashboard.
