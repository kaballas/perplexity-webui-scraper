Topic: E007 - EMPLOYEE TAX DETAILS
Ability for Employees to update their own Tax Details through self-service.
Current State
􀍻 DoE employees, within the current MyHR Self Service Portal offer the ability to update their
Taxation Details
􀍻 Initial Tax records are entered during Onboarding
􀍻 For any complex or Withholding items not listed, employee’s need to contact Payroll Services
Future State - Out of The Box
􀍻 Employees enter Tax Information during Onboarding.
􀍻 Currently employee Tax Details need to be re-entered directly into Employee Central Payroll
upon a successful New Hire event in SuccessFactors
􀍻 No self-service functions are delivered as standard for AU Employees
􀍻 Standard Replication exists for Tax File Number (i.e. National ID to Infotype 227 in ECP)
Enhancement Considerations
􀍻 Options open to DoE will need to be two-fold to account for the different functionality, namely:
􀍻 Self Service functionality. This function could either be developed using an EC MDF Portlet or
through a stand-alone BTP app.
􀍻 Auto update of Onboarding Tax Details directly into ECP. This function will require ABAP
developed on the BTP platform.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central – Self-Service MDF Portlet

At the simplest level, utilising a custom MDF portlet can allow DoE employees to update their tax details.
Flexibility exists in standard configuration to control permissions at the field level to determine what an
employee sees versus what they update.
Employee Central Payroll – HR Infotype Auto Update
Alongside the MDF portlet, an ECP program would be required to read the portlet information and update
the infotype in ECP to ensure the changes are ready for the next pay run. Validations can easily be added
to ensure no retrospective changes are allowed and effective dates are from the start of a pay period.
Employee Central Payroll – Onboarding to HR Infotype Auto Update
SAP Integration Suite can manage the pass through of data from Onboarding to ECP. Upon successful
replication from EC to ECP then Tax Details entered via Onboarding can be saved directly to Infotype 188
in ECP.
