1	Introduction
1.1	Overview
Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the current DoE system a claims portal is utilised for school based casual work for non-teaching positions.  Via a user interface the business manager can enter time and claims for casual non-teacher employees and casual teachers (where not using class cover).

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
By contrast, the standard behavior in SuccessFactors Time Off is to allow individuals to use timesheeting to makes claims.  But there is no school level basis for entering claims and due to the specific location and award interpretations required by DoE the standard functionality does not meet requirements.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation. This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

1.2	Assumptions
To maintain flexibility, the specification is designed to be language-agnostic, supporting various frameworks available on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).  The Department of Education (DoE) should collaborate with their Service Integrator to select the most suitable framework.  For optimal integration and user experience, we recommend adopting the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with an SAPUI5/Fiori-based user interface.
The Teacher ID in Class Cover is the assignment ID from SuccessFactors for the Casual employment.
Standard Payroll Processing can be used to determine payment amounts and other payments using standard configuration and data provided in the IT2010 record.

1.3	Dependencies
That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.

2	System Design
2.1	High Level Design
Overview
The Casual Timesheet Extension (CTE) is a Business Technology Platform (BTP) application accessible from the SuccessFactors homepage for Business Development Managers (BDMs). The application streamlines timesheet management, claim submission, and payroll integration.
Data Retrieval
•	The CTE application retrieves school and employee data from SuccessFactors using OData API calls.
•	Payment type and costing configurations are stored in BTP tables, determining source and override functions for cost centers and classifications.
Claim Submission
•	Claims are saved in the CTE Header and Item tables within BTP.
•	BDMs can submit claims for payment after entering the required data.
•	The claim moves to the approver, the CTE approver table triggers an email notification to the designated approver (The manager can be found from SF via OData negating the table requirement).
•	Approvers can access the application to review, edit and approve the claim. (Note: Approver cannot approve an entry against themselves – this would require approval 1 up of the approver.)
Payroll Integration
•	CTE claim items are replicated to SuccessFactors ECP Payroll via BTP integration.
o	The integration uses the BAPI BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST to pass:Assignment ID,ECP wage ype,Date,Hours/number,Unit,Classification (pay scale group and level),Cost assignment details (cost center, school, location)
•	A logical system number and reference document link the CTE Item to the IT2010 entry in SuccessFactors.
•	Successful integration returns a reference number; failures return an error message, which is recorded in the CTE claim item.
Error Handling and Reprocessing
•	Claims with errors are displayed in the CTE application for payroll administrators.
•	Administrators can view and reprocess erroneous items.
•	The BAPI uses a staging table (PTEX) before loading data into IT2010.
•	The integration runs the program RPTEXTPT in ECP to insert records into IT2010.
•	Errors are logged in the integration log, and payroll administrators can monitor the PTEX staging area for issues.

2.3	BTP Application UI Design
The UI layer should be built using SAPUI5 for SuccessFactors compatibility.
The frontend features should be:
•	Area at the top of the page to select the school via an OData API call to Successfactors and a drop down on the Weeks Starting
•	Then a table is presented with the detailed fields and actions on it
•	Confirmation and error message area.
Detailed UI Elements

Submit	Sends the CTE claim details for approval
Approve	Approves the CTE claim and submits it to ECP for 	For Approvers
Delete	Delete the CTE claim item	If the claim has already been replicated to ECP deletion this is not possible.  Make the button inactive when this is the case
Resend	Resends the CTE claim item via the BTP Integration to ECP.	Only available to payroll admins when an item is in Error
Overrides	Allows classification and cost center to be displayed and override entries if allowed via config.  This is via a pop up screen on the app.	The screen shows the default cost center (from employee position or costing table) and default classification from the config table.  If override is allowed for either field then an extra field for input is shown.  Cost Center from EC OData API and Classification from config.
Employee Replace	Allow entry of the employee assignment that is being replaced.  This would be employee assignments restricted by the school selected.	This can be different for each day.  Pop shows Mon – Fri for employee.
Fav	Ability to set a line as a favorite.  This creates an entry in the BTP table pointing to the item as a favorite.  	When the user selects a school any favorites saved for that school should be displayed for a new claim week. (or via popup before displaying….)
Note: There are a number of business rules around how to find the correct classification for payment types that are loaded against an assignment that need to be determined.  This could be position based, payment type, previous payments for the assignment etc.  This needs to be determined for the build task.
No future dated claims are allowed to be submitted for approval (TBC).

2.5	BTP Integration
Overview
This integration leverages SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) to replicate CTE (Claim Time and Expense) claim items or Class Cover file data into SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll (ECP).  The core mechanism involves calling the BAPI BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST to stage data, followed by executing the program RPTEXTPT to load the data into Infotype 2010 (IT2010).
The integration handles data mapping, success/failure responses, linking via an external number, and error logging/updating in the CTE system. It supports reprocessing of failed items by payroll administrators through a dedicated view in the CTE application.
Key objectives:
•	Automate replication of claim items for payroll processing.
•	Ensure traceability between CTE items and ECP IT2010 entries.
•	Provide robust error handling and visibility for administrators.
Components Involved
•	Source System: CTE application (holds claim items) or Class Cover.
•	Integration Platform: SAP BTP (orchestrates the flow, e.g., via Cloud Integration or custom services).
•	Target System: SuccessFactors ECP Payroll (uses BAPI for staging and program for loading).
•	Key SAP Objects:
o	BAPI: BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST (for inserting data into a staging table).
o	Program: RPTEXTPT (run in ECP to process staged data into IT2010).
o	Infotype: IT2010 (final destination for remuneration specifications).
•	Data Elements Passed:
Field	Description	Source
Assignment ID	Unique identifier for the employee assignment.	CTE Claim Item
ECP Wage Type	Payroll wage type code.	CTE Claim Item
Date	Effective date of the claim.	CTE Claim Item
Hours/Number	Quantity (e.g., hours worked).	CTE Claim Item
Unit	Unit of measure (e.g., hours, days).	CTE Claim Item
Classification	Pay scale group and level.	CTE Claim Item
Cost Assignment	Cost center, school, and location details.	CTE Claim Item
Ref Doc	Generated linking number (for CTE-IT2010 traceability).	Generated/Returned by Integration
Logical System	Ext System – Separate CTE and ClassCover	BTP Constant
Integration Flow (High-Level Steps)
1.	Trigger: The integration is initiated when a CTE claim item is submitted for replication (e.g., via API call).  Or when Class Cover file is received and uploaded into BTP.
2.	Data Extraction and Mapping:
o	Extract claim item data from CTE or Class Cover file.
o	Map fields to BAPI input parameters (e.g., assignment ID to employee/pernr, wage type, date, etc.).
o	Generate a reference number for linking.
o	Set the Logical system dependent on whether this is called by CTE or Class Cover.
3.	BAPI Call:
o	Invoke BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST via BTP (e.g., using RFC or OData adapter).
o	Pass mapped data to insert into the ECP staging table.
o	Handle BAPI response: If successful, hold the reference number; if failed, capture error message.
4.	Data Loading:
o	If BAPI succeeds, trigger the program RPTEXTPT in ECP (e.g., via RFC).
o	This processes the staged data into IT2010.
5.	Response Handling:
o	On success: Return the reference document to CTE and update the claim item record.  For class cover log the success against with the reference document.
o	On failure (at BAPI or program stage): Return error message to CTE, update the claim item, and log the error in the integration log (e.g., BTP monitoring logs).
6.	Error Visibility and Reprocessing:
o	Failed items appear in a dedicated view within the CTE application.
o	Payroll administrators can review errors and manually reprocess items (triggering the integration again).
Error Handling
•	Types of Errors:
o	Validation errors (e.g., invalid wage type).
o	BAPI failures (e.g., staging table insertion issues).
o	Program execution errors (e.g., data not loaded into IT2010).
•	Logging: All errors are captured in BTP integration logs for auditing and debugging.
•	Recovery: CTE updates ensure errors are visible; reprocessing allows admins to retry without data loss.
•	Notifications: Optionally, configure BTP to send alerts (e.g., via email or integration with monitoring tools) for persistent failures.
•	Assumptions and Considerations
•	Authentication: Use secure connections (e.g., OAuth or certificates) between BTP and ECP.
•	Performance: Batch processing for multiple claim items to optimize BAPI calls.
•	Monitoring: Leverage BTP's integration monitoring for real-time status and logs.
•	Testing: Validate end-to-end flow, including edge cases like partial successes or network failures.

Explain the Dependencies That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.
================================================================================

================================================================================
Task 1
================================================================================
Based on the provided specification document (E027 – Casual Timesheet Extension) and the supporting context, here's an explanation of the dependency "That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP":

1.  **Integration Scope:** The BTP application (Casual Timesheet Extension - CTE) isn't just designed to replace the existing Claims Portal functionality. Section 2.5 ("BTP Integration") explicitly states: "This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation." The integration flow description confirms this: "Trigger: The integration is initiated when a CTE claim item is submitted for replication (e.g., via API call). *Or when Class Cover file is received and uploaded into BTP.*"

2.  **Dual Input Source:** The BTP application needs to handle timesheet/claim data from two sources:
    *   The new CTE UI, used by Business Development Managers for non-Class Cover casual work (replacing the Claims Portal).
    *   The Class Cover system, which will presumably generate timesheet/claim data for relief teaching assignments that need to be processed through ECP Payroll.
    The BTP integration must be capable of processing data from *both* sources and sending it to ECP Payroll using the same underlying BAPI (`BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST`) and program (`RPTEXTPT`).

3.  **Logical System Dependency:** Section 2.5 mentions that the "Logical system" is set depending on whether the data comes from CTE or Class Cover. This implies that the integration logic within BTP needs to account for and correctly identify the source of the incoming data.

4.  **Implementation Sequence:** The dependency states that Class Cover must be operational *before* the BTP integration is *required*. This means the BTP application and its core integration mechanism (the BAPI call and program execution) must be developed and ready to *receive and process* data from Class Cover once Class Cover starts producing that data. The BTP integration component cannot be fully *utilized* or tested for the Class Cover data path until Class Cover itself is up and running and generating the expected output files or data feeds.

In essence, the BTP application and its payroll integration are designed as a unified endpoint to receive casual worker payment data, consolidating inputs from both the new CTE UI (for non-teaching/other cases) and the Class Cover system (for teaching relief cases). Therefore, the readiness and operation of the Class Cover system is a prerequisite for the BTP integration to fulfill its complete intended function.

Task 2
================================================================================
## Class Cover System for Queensland Department of Education (DoE)

Based on the provided context, I can explain the Class Cover system as it relates to the BTP integration and payroll processes:

### What is the Class Cover System?

The Class Cover system is a specialized application within the Queensland Department of Education that manages **relief teaching assignments**. It handles the scheduling, tracking, and processing of temporary teaching positions where regular teachers are absent and need to be covered by relief (substitute) teachers.

### Key Characteristics:

**1. Data Generation Purpose:**
- Creates timesheet and claim data for relief teaching assignments
- Processes payment information for substitute teachers who work in educational settings
- Generates structured data files that need to be integrated with payroll systems

**2. Integration Role:**
- Serves as one of **two primary data sources** feeding into the BTP application (alongside the CTE UI)
- Provides timesheet/claim data specifically for **teaching relief cases**
- Will generate data feeds that trigger the BTP integration when files are received and uploaded

**3. Operational Dependency:**
- Must be operational **before** the BTP integration can be fully utilized
- The BTP integration cannot be completely tested for Class Cover data until this system is generating expected output
- Creates a logical system dependency where the source must be ready before the integration can process its data

**4. Processing Flow:**
- When Class Cover files are received and uploaded into BTP → triggers the integration
- Uses the same underlying BAPI (`BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST`) and program (`RPTEXTPT`) as CTE data
- The logical system identifier changes based on whether data originates from Class Cover or CTE

### Business Context:

The Class Cover system represents the **teaching/educational relief component** of the broader casual workforce management, specifically handling substitute teacher assignments, while the CTE (Casual Timesheet Extension) handles non-teaching casual work. Both systems feed into a unified BTP integration point for consolidated payroll processing through SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll (ECP).

[User Feedback]
Explain Both systems feed into a unified BTP integration point how and why ?

================================================================================
Task 3
================================================================================
## How and Why Both Systems Feed into a Unified BTP Integration Point

### **HOW the Integration Works:**

**1. Unified Data Processing Architecture:**
- Both CTE (Casual Timesheet Extension) and Class Cover systems feed into the same **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) application**
- The BTP application uses a **single integration mechanism** with the same core components:
  - BAPI: `BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST` for staging data
  - Program: `RPTEXTPT` for loading data into Infotype 2010 (IT2010)
- A **logical system identifier** differentiates the source (CTE vs Class Cover) within the same integration flow

**2. Dual Trigger Mechanism:**
```
CTE UI → API Call → BTP Integration → ECP Payroll
Class Cover → File Upload → BTP Integration → ECP Payroll
```
- Both sources use the same **staging and processing pipeline** in SuccessFactors ECP
- The integration is initiated when either:
  - A CTE claim item is submitted via API call
  - A Class Cover file is received and uploaded into BTP

**3. Consolidated Data Flow:**
- Both systems write to the **same SuccessFactors Infotype 2010 (IT2010)** 
- Same underlying payroll processing rules apply regardless of source origin
- Centralized error handling, logging, and monitoring for both data streams

### **WHY a Unified Integration Approach:**

**1. Operational Efficiency:**
- **Single Point of Maintenance:** One integration to maintain, monitor, and troubleshoot rather than separate systems
- **Consistent Processing:** Same validation rules, error handling, and processing logic for all casual worker payments
- **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminates need for multiple integration patterns and code bases

**2. Cost and Resource Optimization:**
- **Lower Development Costs:** Build one robust integration instead of two separate solutions
- **Streamlined Testing:** Single test suite covers both data sources
- **Simplified Operations:** One team can manage both data streams

**3. Business Process Alignment:**
- **Unified Payroll Processing:** All casual worker payments (teaching and non-teaching) follow the same payroll workflow
- **Consistent Payment Timing:** Both systems integrate with the same payroll cycles and schedules
- **Standardized Compliance:** Same audit trails and compliance requirements for both data types

**4. Scalability and Future-Proofing:**
- **Easier Enhancements:** Changes to payroll processing logic apply to both systems simultaneously
- **Better Monitoring:** Unified dashboards and alerts for all casual payment data
- **Flexibility:** Can easily add additional casual workforce systems in the future using the same integration framework

**5. Data Integrity and Consistency:**
- **Single Source of Truth:** All casual payment data follows the same validation and processing rules
- **Consistent Reporting:** Same data structure and format regardless of source system
- **Reduced Risk:** Eliminates potential discrepancies between different integration approaches

This unified approach represents a **best practice in enterprise integration architecture**, where the focus is on creating a robust, maintainable, and scalable integration hub that can handle multiple data sources efficiently rather than creating siloed point-to-point integrations.
