   - Maintain metadata lineage using Azure Purview aligned with SAP metadata frameworks.

3. Security and Compliance:
   - Enforce IS18:2018, IPOLA, ACSC security controls in data transmission and storage, leveraging Azure’s Zero Trust and SAP’s identity and access management.
   - Ensure data encryption in transit and at rest with role-based access controls and audit logging.

4. Performance and Scaling:
   - Design for scalable data pipelines supporting phased HCMS rollout from Explore to Realize phases.
   - Use Azure’s scalable compute and storage with cost-optimized batch and streaming integration patterns.

5. Governance Framework:
   - Establish enterprise data governance policies combining SAP Data Sphere capabilities with Azure Purview’s data catalog and compliance controls.
   - Define data stewardship roles across multi-vendor teams (DoE, SAP Partner, Data#3, SI).

In summary, leveraging 2025 SAP and Azure integration best practices—with AI-driven HR data orchestration, cloud-native architectures, strict governance, and modern data mesh/fabric principles—provides a scalable, compliant, and future-proof architecture for Queensland Department of Education’s HCMS.[1][3][5][7]

This approach ensures comprehensive HR data management and analytics aligned with current SAP SuccessFactors and Microsoft Azure capabilities, meeting DoE’s compliance and operational requirements.
