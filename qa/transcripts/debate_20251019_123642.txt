Topic: Teacher Transfer Process
The teacher transfer process will be implemented using BTP and will not be part of the SF RCM standard
solution. This decision is based on the complexity and policy-driven nature of teacher transfers, which
Page | 177
require multi-dimensional eligibility, regional matching, and service-based prioritisation that cannot be
effectively supported through standard RCM configuration. Key reasons include:
􀍻 RCM does not support dynamic vacancy-candidate matching based on service duration, region,
and preference logic.
􀍻 Transfer workflows involve bidirectional approvals (from both source and target schools), which
exceed the capabilities of standard route maps.
􀍻 Internal-facing transfer portals and dashboards are not natively available in RCM
Instead, the Queensland Department of Education will manage teacher transfers via a custom solution on
SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP E011), leveraging flexible development tools and tight
integration with EC and RCM for downstream activities.

POINTS CALCULATION & REPORTING
A teacher's transfer points are calculated in consideration of their service in the last 10 calendar years with
the department, inclusive of the current school year. As each year of service is completed, a teacher's
accrued points total is increased by the level of transfer points which their current location attracts but is
also decreased by the number of points received for the year of service 10 years earlier.
The Teacher Transfer Points Summary Report and the Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will be
developed to support the annual teacher transfer process that is managed by staff in Regional Offices and
coordinated by Human Resources, Central Office.
The Teacher Transfer Points Summary Report and the Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will enable
Regional HR Consultants to view the position and transfer point accrual details, summarised by year, for a
specified employee within their Organisational Units and provide the flexibility to export the output.
The Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will enable Regional HR Consultants to view the total transfer
point balance and the daily service and accrual details for the specified employee.
Current State
Transfer Application Process
The teacher transfer system is accessed through their My HR system and supports teachers who wish to
move to different schools. Transfer requests are guided by specific eligibility criteria, including minimum
service periods. Unlike other roles, transfer jobs are not advertised locally.
Teachers provide detailed application data such as preferred locations, service history, and teaching
areas, which is then used for matching against vacancies.
Applications that are unsuccessful automatically roll over to the following year unless withdrawn or
updated by the teacher. At year-end, teachers are prompted to confirm whether they want their
application to remain active.
As Is Process in DoE
􀁸 Designed to support ongoing applications and placements year-round.
􀁸 Teachers can now apply and be placed anytime.
􀁸 However, this has proven disruptive to principals when teachers leave mid-year.
􀁸 Not all vacancies are listed through the teacher recruitment system.
􀁸 Despite centralisation, bulk placements are still managed by regions using principal-led panels.
Key Elements of the Process
The transfer process can be broken down into three key phases:
􀁸 Request Process – Submission of transfer application.
Page | 229
􀁸 Identification Process – Matching teachers to potential vacancies.
􀁸 Selection Process – Evaluation and placement decision.
System and Technical Details
􀁸 All transfer activity is managed through the TSS teacher transfer system, which is separate from
Springboard.
􀁸 Teachers apply to one unified talent pool across the state but can select multiple preferred
regions.
􀁸 The system closes briefly each year, during which HR manually uploads applications into new
requisitions. An annual advertisement process also occurs during this time.
Future State - Out of The Box
The Teacher Transfer process is an entirely DoE specific requirement that cannot be met through the
standard product.
Enhancement Considerations
Whilst predominately a Teacher process, the design needs to cater for Non-Teaching positions such as
Teacher Aides.
Furthermore, the confirmation of a Transfer window or period needs to be clarified for the final design, i.e.
whether this process of expressing an interest to relocate is done once a year – at then at specific times or
is a process that can be engaged in at any time of the school year.
For the accurate calculation of the transfer points, the following should be considered:
􀁸 Accrual Calculation: Points accrue based on transfer rating levels and years of continuous
service, proportioned by workdays in a school year. The accrual is limited to the last ten years of
service.
􀁸 Transfer Rating Levels: When no transfer rating is assigned, a default level of 1 is applied. If a
rating is reduced, the higher previous rating applies for up to three years.
􀁸 Service Types and Leave: Part-time service accrues points at full-time rates; temporary
engagements count as continuous service if breaks do not exceed 60 school days; unpaid leave
over one month generally excludes accrual except for the first three months of workers’
compensation leave.
􀁸 Special Cases: Transfer points reset to zero upon first preference transfers under specified
conditions and upon formal separation from the Department. Reemployment after separation
does not count previous points.
Page | 230
􀁸 Accelerated Points: Schools with transfer ratings 3 to 7 have accelerated point accrual after
specific years of service, with rules for movements between schools affecting the accelerated
year count.
Contractual Considerations
Transfers do not result in a new employment contract. They are treated as location changes, with all
contractual terms remaining unchanged. Selection steps and transfer status are tracked within the system.
Current Challenges and Discussion Points
􀁸 A significant number (50%) of applications come from teachers wanting to move within their own
region.
􀁸 There’s an ongoing need to improve prioritisation for teachers with rural or remote service.
􀁸 One key focus is quickly placing these priority teachers in preferred locations.
Historic Data
As 10-year History will be required the design will need to consider connection to HR Resource Group for
the pre SuccessFactors history. Additionally, the assumption is that the calculation of Transfer Points
needs to occur in HR Resource Group otherwise all the data to support the last 10 years would need to
be migrated as part of the Cutover.
As such, the design of the BTP App will focus on the user interface and consider the calculation of Transfer
Points out of scope.
Reporting
In addition to the Expression Of Interest App, there should be a Teacher Transfer Details Report that
displays the total transfer point accrued at the end of the calendar year and the daily accrual details
including school transfer rating and accelerated accrual details, for an employee and provide the
flexibility to export the output.
The Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will enable Regional HR Consultants to view the total transfer
point accrued and the daily service accrual details for a specified employee.
The Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will be triggered from the BTP App, but retrieve the necessary
data from HR Resource Group.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
From the Employee Central Home Page, a BTP Application will be accessed by 3 distinct personas:
Employee (Teacher / Teacher Aide)
􀁸 ESS Expression of Interest to relocate
Page | 231
􀁸 Can be Region, School or Multiple Schools
􀁸 Reason for moving (e.g. Compassionate / Hardship etc)
􀁸 Declare Family Dependents
HR / Internal Recruitment
􀁸 Review Talent Pool interested in relocating
􀁸 Run the Teacher Transfer Details Report
􀁸 Action Transfer Status
􀁸 Add details of relocation expenses (Air / Rail / Road / Ship etc.)
Principal / Business Development Manager
􀁸 Review Talent Pool interested in relocating to their school location
􀁸 Action Preference to Hire / Accept employee

## 3. Implementation Approach

### 3.1 Configuration vs. Customization Analysis
- **Standard Configuration**: Employee Central core objects, picklists, basic workflows
- **Custom Configuration**: Custom MDF objects, calculated fields, custom portlets
- **Custom Development**: BTP application for transfer workflow, complex business rules
- **Third-party Integration**: HR Resource Group data migration tools

### 3.2 Phased Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core data structures and historical data loading
- **Phase 2**: Transfer point calculation engine and validation rules
- **Phase 3**: Application workflow and approval processes
- **Phase 4**: Reporting and analytics capabilities
- **Phase 5**: User training and go-live support

### 3.3 Risk Mitigation
- **Data Quality Risk**: Implement comprehensive validation during historical data load
- **Performance Risk**: Optimize daily batch processing with parallel execution
- **Integration Risk**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **User Adoption Risk**: Provide comprehensive training and change management
