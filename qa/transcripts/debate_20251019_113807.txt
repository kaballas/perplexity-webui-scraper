Topic: Corporate Based Hiring
In the future state, all corporate and regional recruitment will be managed within SAP SuccessFactors
Recruiting Management, covering a broad range of functional areas such as administration, HR and
support roles. Job requisitions for corporate positions will be created either via Position Management in
Employee Central linked to approved, funded position or through the copy-create option.
The primary requisition template used will be the
􀁸 Corporate/Region Job Requisition
􀍻 School Based Classified Officer Job Requisition
􀁸 Exception from Advertising Requisition
􀍻 Expression of Interest (EOI) Requisition
􀍻 School Support Job Requisition
􀍻 Generic Job Requisition (Evergreen)
Each corporate requisition will follow a role-specific approval workflow, which will include the hiring
manager, Upline manager(delegate) and corporate recruitment team. The approval process will ensure
appropriate oversight and alignment with internal governance before advertising the role/job.
Candidates will apply through the external careers site, and may also be sourced via internal job postings,
LinkedIn, SmartJobs, or targeted recruitment campaigns. Screening will be conducted by recruiters and
hiring managers, focusing on qualifications, experience, and alignment with role expectations. Working
rights, conflict of interest declarations will be captured during the screening process.
Panel members will complete a standard selection report template offline, sign it, and upload it to the
candidate’s application in SuccessFactors. At the same time, key selection details (such as scoring,
recommendations, and conflict of interest declarations) will be entered directly into the application fields
in RCM. This process will take place before offer letter stage.
Offer letters for corporate roles will be generated dynamically using configured templates, incorporating
classification details, tenure, and negotiated conditions. Once accepted, the onboarding process will be
triggered, ensuring a smooth transition for new hires into their assigned roles.
Teacher & School Based Hiring
In the future state, all teacher and school-based recruitment will be managed within SAP SuccessFactors
Recruiting Management, supporting a range of appointment types including permanent, temporary, and
policy-based hires. Job requisitions for these roles will be created via Position Management in Employee
Central and linked to an approved school-based position or through the copy-create function for repeat
roles. The following requisition templates will be available to support diverse hiring scenarios:

􀍻 Exception from Advertising Requisition
Each requisition type will have a unique approval workflow, which are documented in detail in below
section and in the recruiting workbook. Candidates will be sourced via the external career site and smart
jobs or moved from eligibility and talent pools. Offers will be dynamically generated based on
classification, FTE, and contract type, and upon acceptance, onboarding will be triggered automatically.
This structure ensures a flexible yet compliant approach to managing school-based workforce needs
across DoE.
The Teacher & School Based hiring will use evergreen requisitions referred to as Teacher Eligibility Job
Requisition (Evergreen) to continuously attract and assess candidates for high-volume and frequently
recruited teaching roles across DoE. These requisitions are not tied to a specific position or FTE but
instead serve as the front door to the teaching pipeline. Candidates applying through evergreen
requisitions will be screened by recruiters for baseline eligibility and then marked as “Job Ready” when
suitable for active placement.
This approach enables proactive pipelining by capturing and maintaining a pool of prequalified
candidates who can be moved into school-specific requisitions when vacancies arise. Recruiters will
manage these pools through candidate statuses (e.g. New Application, Identity Verification, Future
teachers etc) and will initiate manual movement of candidates into real requisitions based on subject
expertise, location preferences, and hiring priorities.
Evergreen requisitions will remain open year-round and will not close after a hire. The recruiter will
appropriately segregate candidates in relevant status and will move selected candidates to child
requisition where the actual hiring of candidate will take place. The Evergreen functions as an ongoing
intake mechanism to build and refresh the DoE’s teacher talent pool, helping reduce time to fill and
ensuring readiness across peak recruitment periods.
DoE Job Requisition Templates
Corporate Job Requisition
􀍻 Corporate/Region Job Requisition - Used to recruit for non-school-based administrative, ICT,
finance, and policy roles across corporate and regional offices, created via position management
or copy-create.
􀍻 School Based Classified Officer Job Requisition - for the recruitment or relocation of formally
appointed teachers who hold a permanent classification within DoE.
􀍻 Expression of Interest (EOI) Requisition – for temporary or short-term internal opportunities.

􀍻 Exception from Advertising Requisition – to support policy-based appointments that do not
require open advertisement (e.g., compassionate transfers, medical return to work, closed merit
process).
􀍻 School Support Job Requisition – for hiring administration and support staff within schools
(non-teaching roles).
􀍻 Generic Job Requisition (Evergreen) - for general suitability for future talent.
Teacher Job Requisition
􀍻 Teacher Eligibility Job Requisition (Evergreen) – to assess general suitability for teaching
roles and maintain a pool of “job ready” candidates.
􀍻 Teacher Job Requisition – to recruit for specific classroom roles (e.g., “Cairns Maths Teacher”).
􀍻 Exception from Advertising Requisition – to support policy-based appointments that do not
require open advertisement (e.g., compassionate transfers, medical return to work, closed merit
process).
Requisition Creation & Approval
Initiation Method: In the future state, the job requisition creation process in SAP SuccessFactors will begin
primarily from the Position Management framework in Employee Central. Approved and vacant positions
will serve as the foundation for initiating requisitions, ensuring alignment with the Queensland Department of
Education of Education’s establishment controls. Where appropriate, users can also leverage the copycreate
functionality to duplicate existing requisitions, particularly useful in high-volume scenarios like
school-based teaching roles or classified officer hires. For teacher recruitment, if multiple hires are
required from a single FTE (e.g., 1.0 FTE split across two 0.5 positions), separate requisitions will be
created for each role using distinct position IDs. The system will be designed to enforce a one-to-one
relationship between an open requisition and a position ID, preventing multiple active requisitions from
referencing the same position simultaneously. For over-establishment recruitment scenarios—where a
role exists outside of the funded establishment—requisitions can still be created, but must be supported
by a prior risk assessment and approval process managed through ServiceNow.
Once a requisition is initiated, the system will trigger a defined approval workflow based on the type of
role and template selected. For school-based roles, this may involve the principal, a regional HR business
partner, an endorser (where applicable), and a school delegate, ensuring all stakeholders sign off before
the job is advertised. Corporate and classified requisitions will follow a more streamlined route, typically
involving the hiring manager, a delegate, and the recruiter. Approvals will be tracked through
SuccessFactors’ route map configuration, with support for ad hoc approvers where necessary. In cases
where roles are filled through Expressions of Interest (EOIs) or policy-based pathways (e.g., Exception
from Advertising), the system will allow requisition creation without external posting, and will still follow
internal approvals to ensure accountability. Each requisition will be tied to the correct template—whether
for eligibility pool, school-specific, corporate, or EOI recruitment—ensuring consistent data capture and
downstream reporting.
