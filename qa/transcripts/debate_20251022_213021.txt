1	Introduction
1.1	Overview
Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the existing DoE system, leave balances are shown at the employee level, aggregating all entitlements, accruals, and usages for an individual across multiple roles.  This consolidated view simplifies tracking for leave types like recreation leave, sick leave, etc
Balances are also converted when an award change occurs to an employment in the TSS system.

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
In contrast, SuccessFactors handles leave balances at an assignment level, managing independent time accounts, accrual rules, and holiday calendars for each job or concurrent employment.  For example, an employee with multiple roles (e.g., teacher and administrator) has separate entitlements per assignment, with absences booked accordingly to ensure accuracy and payroll integration.  This granularity supports job change adjustments and negative balance restrictions but requires navigating separate views in the Time Off module, which can complicate user experience compared to aggregated systems.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires employees with concurrent employment to view all assignment-linked leave balances on one screen, bridging the gap between DoE's employee-level view and SuccessFactors' assignment granularity.  A BTP Application fills this by retrieving and consolidating data via SuccessFactors APIs (e.g., REST for timeAccountBalances) in real-time.  Built on SAP BTP with CAP for backend and UI5 for frontend, it offers unified dashboards, secure permissions, and features like notifications or transfers, enhancing compatibility without altering core configurations.
For the Balances to be converted on an award change then an event driven architecture is required to fire a BTP integration to adjust the required balances.

1.2	Assumptions
To maintain flexibility, the specification is designed to be language-agnostic, supporting various frameworks available on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).  The Department of Education (DoE) should collaborate with their Service Integrator to select the most suitable framework.  For optimal integration and user experience, we recommend adopting the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with an SAPUI5/Fiori-based user interface.
DoE should be able to use the standard SuccessFactors leave applications as a fallback position – therefore the BTP application must use the standard APIs and processes.

1.5	Concurrent Employment in SuccessFactors and ECP
In SuccessFactors Employee Central, concurrent employments for a single person are identified by:
o	A single personIdExternal (unique to the person across all employments).
o	Multiple userId values (one for each employment – also known as assignment).
When this data is replicated to SAP ECP via Point-to-Point (P2P) replication or another integration method, each userId typically maps to a unique Personnel Number (PERNR) in ECP.
The Concurrent Employment feature in SAP ECP allows a single person to have multiple PERNRs, linked by a Central Person (CP) object, which corresponds to the personIdExternal from SuccessFactors.
Using principal propagation between SuccessFactors and BTP the current users personIdExternal should be known via Single Sign On.



2	Design
2.1	High Level Design
To provide a seamless experience for employees to view leave balances across multiple assignments, a custom SAP BTP application retrieves data from SuccessFactors using OData APIs and presents it in a unified UI. The process is designed to align with the Department of Education's need for employee-level balance visibility while leveraging SuccessFactors' assignment-level data structure.
1.	Fetch Assignments: Get personIdExternal from user credentials; query EmpEmployment for assignments, including userId, assignmentId, employmentId, and job details.
2.	Fetch Balances: Query the timeAccountBalance REST endpoint using assignmentId for each assignment; use $at for past/current; for future projections over 12 months, calculate in BTP using daily accrual rates from the TimeProfile, adding estimated accruals.
3.	Display: Consolidate balances in SAPUI5-based UI with dashboards and filters for easy viewing.


Leave crosss counting conversion happens when an employee changes their planned working hours via an award change on an assignment.  This can be achieved using the SAP BTP Advaned Event Mesh service to trigger an Integration.
2.2	Key Components
The system comprises the following main components:
•	SuccessFactors (SF) System:
o	Source of truth for leave balances.
o	Includes Employee Central (EC) for employment information and OData entities and REST endpoints for read operations.
•	SAP BTP Platform:
o	BTP Table/Database: Custom tables in SAP HANA on BTP to store time profiles and related time types, accrual estimations by time type for projections over 12 months.    Tables need to be designed for the conversion rules for DoE so Leave Balance conversion can occur in BTP. (Note: a utility BTP application may be required for showing how the conversion occurs and the calculations are made).  If there are audit requirements for the conversion then an additional table and step is required in the conversion process.
o	BTP Integration Flows: An integration process (e.g., using SAP Cloud Integration) that fetches time profiles and time types from SF and updates the BTP tables.  Flow to implement the leave balances cross counting conversions is also required.
o	Fiori Frontend Application: A SAPUI5/Fiori app hosted on BTP for user interactions, including input field and validation logic.
•	APIs and Interfaces:
o	SF OData API/REST Endpoint: For reading leave balances in EC.

2.3	Data Model
Time Profile and Time Account Type Replication.
The time profile and time account types will be used across
The following OData entities/REST Endpoints can be called in SuccessFactors to return the required information.
SF OData Entity	Key/Filter	Return	Notes
PerEmail	emailAddress	personIdExternal	Fetch the employee level ID via authenticated employee.
EmpEmployement	personIdExternal	userId, employmentId	Fetch the different assignments for the employee
TimeAccountType		externalCode	The different AccountTypes for the Balance call.
timeAccountBalances	asssignmentId, $at	Balances	Connection via OAuth2 but requires call at assignment level.


2.4	Functional Flows
2.4.1	Leave Balances in BTP
•	UI Elements:
•	Input field for selecting a projection date.
•	List/Table of assignments with time account types (leave types) and balances in hours (per assignment).
•	Process:
1.	Start by fetching the personIdExternal for the current logged in user from the framework.
2.	Next, fetch the current EmpEmployment records associated with that personIdExternal using an OData API call. This should return the UserId, while expanding the jobInfoNav entity and selecting details like Assignment ID, Job Title, Time Profile, FTE, End Date and Pay Scale Level.
3.	For each employment, fetch the Time Account Types using the associated Time Profile (From the BTP tables to reduce API calls).
4.	Default the application with the balances as at todays date but allow the user to select a projection date (current or future) to view their leave balance after the initial load.
5.	Fetch the effective Leave Balances through the timeAccountBalances REST Endpoint, utilizing the assignmentId for each call.
6.	If the selected date is in the future:
a.	(If over 12months) Retrieve the daily accrual rate for each timeAccountType held in the BTP table.
b.	Adjust the future date if the employment ends before the projection date.
c.	Calculate the projected balance by adding the accrued leave (daily accrual rate × number of days from current date (+12 months) to selected date) to the balance returned from the timeAccountBalances.
7.	If the selected date is the current date or up to 12 months in the future, use the balance from timeAccountBalances REST Endpoint passing the $at = selected date.
8.	Finally, list the balances (current or projected) for display.

2.5	BTP Application Validations
Don’t allow the user to select a projection date in the past.
Use REST Endpoint for up to 12 month projections then switch to BTP logic for determining projections past 12 months.

2.6	BTP Application UI Mock Screens

The leave type and assignment fields should be sortable.  To allow the end user to see their balances by different methods.

2.7	BTP Integration for Leave Balance Cross Counting Conversion on Award Level Change
Award Level Change Event Execution:
•	Trigger: when an Award Level change occurs in the SuccessFactors EC system an intelligent service event is raised passing through the date of award change and the user id/assignment id.  The BTP Advanced Event Mesh (AEM) acts as an event broker and fires the BTP integration.
•	Steps:
o	If the date change is in the future, then it is saved into a BTP future events table.
o	If the change is not in the future, then the Leave Balance Conversion integration is called
Leave Balance Conversion Execution:
•	Trigger: via the Award Change Event Integration or via a background job running over the BTP future events table when the change date is reached.
•	Steps:
o	Read the assignment standard weekly hours, award and required job info from the EmpJob OData entity for Date of change and the Day before.  If the planned hours value has not changed then exit the integration.
o	Read the leave type (to be determined from workbooks) balances via REST API endpoint timeAccountBalances using the $at date of the day before the change and pass the assignment id.
o	Determine the conversion rule for the leave type and award from and to.   Use the conversion rule to determine the correction that is required.
o	Create a TimeAccountDetail record in SuccessFactors via OData V2 API for the source assignment: Set bookingType = "MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT", negative quantity (deduction)/positive quantity(addition), linked to the source timeAccountExternalCode.
o	Use OData upsert operation (POST to /TimeAccountDetail) with required fields:
	timeAccountExternalCode: ID of the time account. (This is taken from the timeAccountBalances data)
	bookingDate: Old jobinfo Date.
	quantity: Amount to adjust (positive or negative).
	unit: "HOURS".
	comment: "Balance Conversion Adjustment from BTP”
•	API Authentication: Use OAuth or principal propagation from BTP to SuccessFactors.
•	Error Handling: Log errors in BTP and push to the payroll admin team

2.8	Authorizations
The employees will require the API access to the specific OData entities.
The BTP application will be available to all employees and is a read only application.
SAP BTP applications are moving to an Authorization Management Service (AMS), restricting operations like Create is handled through a policy-based approach integrated into the CAP model.  The policy can be refined in the SAP Cloud Identity Service (SCI) console for attribute-based access control (ABAC) or role-based access control (RBAC). This ensures operations are restricted based on user roles, attributes, or instance-specific conditions, following the principle of least privilege.
https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/authorization-management-service-in-sap-cloud-identity-service/ba-p/13881014
The BTP Integration OAuth user will be required to have access to all employees to be able to read the assignment leave balances.
3	Usage
3.1	Cutover Considerations
The Leave Balances need to be loaded into EC against the assignments of the Employees.  This will require a mapping exercise to determine if the current incumbency records are a true concurrent assignment or require merging with an employee’s existing assignment.

# Critique of E003 Leave Balance Overview Specification

## **Critical Missing Elements**

### **1. Integration Architecture Gaps**
- **No integration mapping details** - The high-severity issue from Context 0 specifically mentions "Detailed integration mapping for custom leave types and BTP applications with EC/ECP workflows and reporting" as an evidence gap
- **Missing BTP enhancement specifications** (E003/E004) referenced in Context 0
- **No mention of Deferred Leave and Purchase Leave** integration with the BTP application
- **Missing ECP integration specifications** - Context 0 references "EC to ECP Integration Spec"

### **2. Reporting & Analytics**
- **No reporting integration** - How will consolidated balances appear in standard SuccessFactors reports?
- **Missing payroll integration details** - Context 3 mentions "retro processing in Payroll" but no linkage to the BTP application
- **No mention of analytics or data warehouse considerations**

### **3. Data Consistency & Synchronization**
- **No data refresh/caching strategy** - How often does the BTP app sync with SuccessFactors?
- **No handling of concurrent updates** - What happens if leave is booked while someone is viewing the consolidated balance?
- **Missing error handling for API failures** - What if SuccessFactors APIs are unavailable?

### **4. Performance & Scalability**
- **No performance considerations** - Multiple API calls per user session could cause latency
- **Missing load testing requirements**
- **No fallback mechanism** if BTP application is unavailable

## **Technical Design Issues**

### **5. Security & Compliance**
- **Insufficient authorization details** - Section 2.8 mentions "read only" but doesn't address who can view whose balances
- **No data privacy considerations** for consolidated views
- **Missing audit trail requirements** for balance conversions

### **6. Business Logic Gaps**
- **No handling of conflicting leave policies** across different assignments
- **Missing validation for total available balances** vs. individual assignment balances
- **No consideration of negative balance scenarios** across assignments

### **7. Conversion Rules Definition**
- **Conversion rules are referenced but not defined** - Section 2.7 mentions "determine the conversion rule" but provides no specification
- **No clear business rules** for when cross-counting conversions should occur

## **Missing Dependencies & Assumptions**

### **8. Unaddressed Dependencies**
- **Accrual lookup tables** mentioned in Context 0 but not referenced in specification
- **Holiday category configurations** not linked to the BTP application
- **Time profile replication timing** not specified

### **9. Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **No test scenarios** for concurrent employment cases
- **Missing UAT criteria**
- **No regression testing considerations** for existing Time Off workflows

## **Recommended Additions**

### **10. Operational Considerations**
- **Monitoring and alerting** for API connectivity issues
- **Data archival and retention** policies for BTP tables
- **Change management** strategy for user adoption
- **Training requirements** for different user types

### **11. Error Handling & Recovery**
- **Retry mechanisms** for failed API calls
- **Data reconciliation** processes
- **Manual override capabilities** for exceptional cases

## **Immediate Action Items**

1. **Create detailed integration mapping** document linking BTP application to all EC/ECP workflows
2. **Define conversion business rules** for award changes
3. **Specify reporting requirements** and how consolidated data appears in standard reports
4. **Add performance SLAs** and caching strategies
5. **Include security matrix** showing who can access what data
6. **Create fallback procedures** when BTP application is unavailable

The specification addresses the basic functional requirement but lacks the comprehensive integration, security, and operational details needed for a production implementation of this complexity.
