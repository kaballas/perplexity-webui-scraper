Topic: E004b – LEAVE REQUEST WITH UNPAID UNITS
Ability to combine Paid and Unpaid units.
Current State
􀍻 DoE employees with insufficient Sick Leave balance are allowed to continue to book leave and
take part of the absence as Leave Without Pay (LWOP).
􀍻 Upon requesting leave, if the balance requires some LWOP the employee will be presented with
the option accept the leave request acknowledging it will contain some unpaid units.
􀍻 Approvers will be presented with the same information, including a clear split of Paid and Unpaid
Units.
Future State - Out of The Box
􀁸 Employees leave balance contains rules to determine whether or not the leave balance can go
into negative. If a negative balance is not allowed, any leave request that exceeds the remaining
balance with result in an error.
􀁸 If the employee still wishes to take the full absence, they would be required to enter two separate
leave requests (1 sick leave, 1 LWOP) and the Approver would have two leave requests to
approve.
Enhancement Considerations
The Employee Central Time Off User Interface is restricted in a deliberate Cloud design to prevent the
ability to customise the behaviour too far away from the standard product. As such introducing a concept
of an ‘Unpaid’ element to paid leave types would ordinarily not be easy. However, given there is another
BTP Extension ‘E004 – Employee Consolidated Leave Request’ in scope it makes sense to incorporate
this requirement into that extension.
A consequence of combing the enhancements is all employees would need to use the BTP Application in
order to be able to request unpaid units in their leave request.
Enhancement Design
Processing Logic
Page | 214
In the case of DoE, if a BTP App extension app is being built for Leave Request to cater for multiple
assignments, it can therefore be extended to include the logic to split the leave request into two,
specifically considering:
1. Defining what leave types are permitted to include an unpaid element.
Allowing employees to book Sick Leave with LWOP but not Long Service Leave (for example)
2. Presenting a dialog box to the user.
Allowing employees to accept advising them some portion of the request will contain unpaid elements.
System Validation
Consideration should be given to the associated business validation required, such as:
􀍻 Can sick leave be requested with a zero balance?
􀍻 Is there any maximum / threshold for the unpaid items?
􀍻 Can an employee request this retrospectively and create an overpayment?
Extended Leave Without Pay (>9 Days)
Where Unpaid Units exceed 9 Working Days the expectation is the employee will be put on ‘Pay Paused’ –
this prevents the employee from being paid until such time as confirmation has been received that the
employee has returned to work.
Achieving this status in Payroll can be achieved in a number of different ways, for example the Indicator
‘Personnel Number locked for payroll’ can be set in Payroll Status (Infotype 0003); however given this
process is embedded in the leave request itself the recommended approach here is to change the end
date of the Unpaid leave to 31.12.9999, meaning the employee will not get paid until the leave is updated
once the employee has returned to work and the exact amount of leave taken can be verified and
updated accordingly.
