Topic: E001 - SALARY INCREMENT
Salary Increment progression is the process whereby an employee advances through their assigned
classification automatically until they reach the maximum pay point. The following processes are in scope:
􀍻 Manage Senior Teacher
􀍻 Manage Experienced Senior Teacher
􀍻 Manage Teacher Aide
􀍻 Manage Increments
Current State
􀍻 Automated Increment Progression supported by Fortnightly Increment Runs and Additional
Nightly Runs
􀍻 Exception and Error Reporting
􀍻 Manual Check Reasons
The following scenarios impact an employee’s project salary increment date (dependant on award):
Service Related
􀍻 Recognised Prior Service
􀍻 Higher Duties
􀍻 Leave Without Pay
Non-Service Related
􀍻 Setting Professional Goals (SPG)
􀍻 Senior Teacher Personal Action Plan (STAP)
Future State - Out of The Box
Given the EBA specific rules associated with Salary Increment, there is no equivalent functionality existing
in SuccessFactors, hence a custom extension is required.
Enhancement Considerations
Overview
Increments for Department of Education employees are influenced by several key components:
􀍻 Period of Service/Tenure: This refers to the duration an employee has served at an assigned
Classification and Paypoint. Increments for departmental employees are typically awarded
annually or bi-annually based on this tenure. Breaks in service will impact of incremental
progression.
􀍻 Periods of Eligible Higher Duties Service: Employees who assume higher duties may have this
service recognised towards their increment on the base or substantive classification.
􀍻 Service Exclusions Due to Leave Without Pay: Certain unpaid leave types as outlined under
the schedule of directive - leave without salary credited as service, including but not limited to
conditions for sick, parental, and other special leave may result in an exclusion for increment
calculation purposes. For example, an employee on Parental Leave no pay for 12 months will
have the first three months credited as eligible service for incremental progression. The remaining
9 months of leave period will be an exclusion.
Page | 195
In addition to the above classifications, the following factors apply when determining the increment date:
􀍻 Performing Duties at the Same or Lower Classification:
○ Service performed at the same salary classification level is counted towards the employee's
increment.
○ Service performed at a lower salary classification level is not counted towards the
employee's substantive salary classification increment. This would constitute as a break in
service for increment purposes when calculating the employees base/substantive
incremental progression. Applies to all employee types.
○ Cross counting rules. DoE currently maintain a table which governs which roles count as
service towards other roles for increments. For example, service as a Teacher may count
towards service as a Teacher Aide, but not vice versa.
􀍻 Performing Duties at a Higher Classification:
○ Service performed at a higher classification level is counted towards the substantive position.
○ For temporary employees, Higher Duties refer to situations where an engagement at a lower
classification ends to begin another engagement at a higher classification. If re- engaged at a
later point at the lower classification, the service previously completed at the higher
classification should count towards the lower one, provided that the break in service is not
greater than 12 months (for non-teachers).
○ When a temporary teacher performs contracts (consecutive or concurrent) at a higher
classification level, the service in the higher classification counts towards the increment in the
lower classification, but not vice versa.
○ Dependant on certain criteria, employees performing higher duties may be eligible for an
increment on the higher classification level. Refer Higher duties directive (12 months service
within 24-month period).
○ Cross counting rules. DoE currently maintain a table which governs which roles count as
service towards other roles for increments. For example, service as a Teacher may count
towards service as a Teacher Aide, but not vice versa.
􀍻 Concurrent Employment:
○ Employee working in two separate roles at the same time e.g., Admin Officer 0.6FTE &
Teacher Aide 0.4FTE, will be entitled to increment in each position separately.
􀍻 Payroll Maintenance of Salary Increments:
○ The ability to manually adjust (Bring forward or delay) is required - Includes Calendar Days,
School Days, Hours. For example, if an employee has 8 months service with Queensland
Health as an AO301 and transfers to DoE at the same level, they would only need to serve 4
months before being entitled to increment. In this case an entry of 8 months is manually
entered by a payroll operator the system will automatically apply the increment after a
further 4 months service.
Increment Cohorts
Increments for Teachers
􀍻 Increments for permanent teachers are based on Calendar Days worked
􀍻 Increments for temporary teachers are based on School Days worked.
Page | 196
􀍻 FTE (full time equivalent fraction) is not applicable. All employees regardless of their assigned FTE
will progress by either annual or bi-annual increment, dependent on the specific rules for their
Award/Classification/Position
􀍻 Leave exclusions apply (in accordance with the Leave without Salary Credited as Service
Directive)
􀍻 Paid leave does not affect an increment. All paid leave is counted as service.
􀍻 Service deemed as 'higher duties' counts towards incremental progression on the substantive
salary. It can also count to periods of relieving (i.e., the higher relieving classification will count as
service towards a lower relieving classification, but not vice versa).
􀍻 Higher duties ceasing over the Christmas vacation period i.e., ceasing last day of school year and
commencing 1st day of next year is not considered to be a break in service for increment
purposes.
􀍻 All prior teaching service is counted in the calculation of salary increments for teachers,
irrespective of breaks greater than 12 months.
􀍻 When changing from temporary to permanent employment (or vice versa); service is converted
from school days to calendar days, or the inverse when changing from permanent to temporary
employment.
○ Formula for conversion of temporary to permanent service: Total school days served * 360 /
200
○ Formula for conversion of permanent to temporary service: Total service days in period * 200
/ 360.
􀍻 A teacher with temporary employment status who ceases work one week prior to the end of the
school year can have service credited to the last day of the school year if they work at a 7-week
school.
􀍻 Retrospective changes should occur where an increment which has already been applied is
affected by a change made to an employee's service (such as shortening or extension of
engagements, leave without pay affecting increments etc.)
􀍻 Classroom Teachers
○ Increment every 12 months (unless subject to a Managing Unsatisfactory Performance plan
(MUP) or disciplinary action)
○ Maximum salary for teachers under the Classroom Teacher Stream is Band 3
○ Once a teacher has reached Band 3 Step 4, the teacher will no longer progress through the
salary scale except where a teacher accesses the Senior Teacher salary
􀍻 Senior Teachers
In order progress to Senior Teacher, an employee must satisfy the following conditions:
○ One year's teaching service at Band 3 Step 4; and
○ Teacher Annual Performance Review (APR)
○ Senior Teacher Undertaking and Personal action plan (STAP) as part of the APR Maximum
􀁸 Experienced Senior Teachers (Paypoint 1)
In order progress to Experienced Senior Teacher (Paypoint 1), an employee must satisfy the
following conditions:
Page | 197
􀍻 Two or more years' satisfactory service as a…
○ Senior Teacher (ST) or
○ Senior Instrumental Music Teacher (SMIT); or
􀍻 Five or more years' satisfactory service as a Senior Instrumental Music Instructor (SIMI); and
○ APR discussion between the teacher and their principal in the past 12 months.
􀍻 Experienced Senior Teachers (Paypoint 2)
In order progress to Experienced Senior Teacher (Paypoint 2), an employee must satisfy the following
conditions:
○ Three or more years' satisfactory service as a…
􀁸 Experienced Senior Teacher (Paypoint 1); and
○ APR discussion between the teacher and their principal in the past 12 months.
Note, there is a planned directive to introduce Paypoint 3.
􀍻 Promotional Teachers
○ Increment every 24 months until reaching the 3rd Paypoint of the assigned classification level.
Increments for Non-Teaching Positions
Increments are applied to Award groups other than teachers. Other Award groups include:
○ Administrative Officers
○ Professional Officers
○ Technical Officers
○ Operational Officers
○ Senior Officers
○ Senior Executives
○ Health Practitioners
○ Nurses
○ Cleaners
○ Teacher Aides
○ Assistant/Community Teachers
􀍻 Casual Service
Casual work performed under the same classification stream is included in the service calculation of
an increment (this does not apply to teachers).
