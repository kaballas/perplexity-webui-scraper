Round 1 - AskQuestions
================================================================================
As a curious inquirer, I'd like to ask several clarifying questions about the WRICEF framework for Data Migration of Positions that could help deepen our understanding:

**Scope and Boundaries:**
- What specific position data elements are we migrating - just structural information (title, hierarchy, reporting relationships) or also associated attributes like salary ranges, FTE values, and position descriptions?
- How does the WRICEF framework account for historical position data versus current/active positions, particularly for audit and compliance requirements?

**Integration Dependencies:**
- You mentioned unresolved integration dependencies from the debate - how might position data migration impact or be impacted by employee master data, organizational management structures, or payroll configurations?
- What downstream systems or processes depend on accurate position data that we need to consider during migration?

**Change Management Implications:**
- Given the emphasis on stakeholder engagement and continuous alignment in the change management artifacts, who are the critical stakeholders for position data migration specifically, and how might changes to position structures affect their day-to-day operations?
- How will position changes be communicated to affected employees and managers to ensure adoption and minimize disruption?

**Technical Architecture:**
- What are the source systems for position data, and what transformation rules will be needed to align with the target system's position management model?
- Are there any position data quality issues or inconsistencies across source systems that need to be addressed before migration?

**Risk and Validation:**
- What validation mechanisms will ensure position data integrity post-migration, particularly for complex organizational hierarchies or matrix reporting structures?
- How do we handle positions that may be in flux during the implementation timeline?

These questions aim to uncover assumptions and identify areas requiring deeper exploration before moving to the realization phase.
