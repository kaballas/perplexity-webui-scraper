Topic: Based on the HCMS Technical Overview, the key components of the Department of Education's new platform are structured around two foundational pillars: the SAP platform and the Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG).
SAP platform
SAP SuccessFactors: Provides the foundation for core HR functions, including Employee Central, Payroll, Recruitment, and Onboarding.
SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP): Enables API-based communication, identity federation, and extensibility for the SAP modules.
SAP Integration Suite: The connectivity layer for exchanging data between SAP components and other platforms like Microsoft Fabric.
SAP Data Sphere: A semantic and modeling layer that harmonizes HR and payroll data from various SAP sources before it is sent to the HR RG.
SAP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management): Governs testing, change control, and release documentation for the SAP components.
SAP Build Apps: Used for developing custom, low-code extensions for HR workflows.
OpenText Extended Enterprise Content Manager (xECM) for SAP SuccessFactors: Manages document generation and storage for employment records.
OpenText InfoArchive: A future-scope component for long-term archiving of historical HR and payroll documents from decommissioned systems.
Joule: Delivers AI-assisted analytics and insights within the HR user experience.
Signavio: Supports process analysis.
SAP WalkMe: Provides guided user experiences, onboarding, and digital adoption.
Microsoft Azure technologies
Microsoft Fabric-based HCMS HR Resource Group (HR RG): The data backbone of the program, acting as the single source of truth, master data management (MDM) layer, and "golden record" for all HR and payroll data.
Medallion Architecture: The HR RG is built on this pattern, with bronze, silver, and gold layers for data ingestion, staging, and business-ready datasets.
Azure DataHub: Used for ingesting all data into the HR RG.
Dataflows and Notebooks: Used for data transformation within Fabric.
Terraform and Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines: Used for provisioning and automating the HR RG.
Microsoft Purview: Governs data classification, lineage, and metadata.
Microsoft Sentinel: The future monitoring solution for audit trails and alerting, replacing Splunk.
Power BI Gateway (On-Prem gateway): Facilitated the ingestion of data from the legacy TSS system into Fabric during the proof of concept phase.
Downstream systems
The HCMS will integrate with numerous downstream systems that will source HR data from the new HR RG, including:
CIS
IAM
Alloc8
SBS
OneSchool


Data Flow and Integration
1. Transformation logic: SAP Data Sphere vs. Microsoft Fabric
SAP Data Sphere: Transformation logic here is focused on semantic harmonization and modeling for HR and payroll data specifically within the SAP ecosystem. It creates a "business data fabric" that maintains SAP-specific business context, preparing the data for consumption by the HR RG in a business-ready format.
Microsoft Fabric Dataflows: These are for general-purpose data transformation, including cleansing, staging, and enrichment, following the Medallion Architecture pattern. Fabric is agnostic to the data source and handles transformations for all data, including non-SAP sources.
Determination: The choice of where to transform data depends on the purpose and context. Use Data Sphere for deep, SAP-specific transformations and semantic modeling. Use Fabric for universal data processing and blending data from SAP with other enterprise data sources.
2. Data synchronization failure
SAP Integration Suite: This is the connectivity layer that provides monitoring and logging for data exchange between SAP and Fabric.
Azure DevOps/Terraform: These tools are used for the CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation of the HR RG. They can automatically restart ingestion jobs or flag failures for human intervention.
Recovery and Reconciliation: The process involves:
Alerting: Splunk (and eventually Microsoft Sentinel) will trigger alerts for integration failures based on logs from both SAP Integration Suite and Azure services.
Monitoring: Monitoring dashboards will show the status of integration flows and identify any data discrepancies.
Troubleshooting: The integration logs will be examined to pinpoint the cause of the failure, such as network issues, API limitations, or data format problems.
Re-execution: Depending on the failure type and idempotency of the data, the integration pipeline can be re-executed for the failed data batch.
Reconciliation: Automated or manual processes are used to compare data in SuccessFactors with the HR RG and resolve any discrepancies. For high-stakes data like payroll, a rigorous, manual reconciliation process is typical.
3. Handling real-time vs. batch data updates
Batch Updates: Used for large volumes of historical or less time-sensitive data (e.g., end-of-month payroll GL entries). SAP Integration Suite and Fabric's built-in connectors support large-scale batch extraction from SAP systems.
Real-Time Updates: Used for critical, time-sensitive events (e.g., employee lifecycle changes like hires and terminations). SAP Integration Suite would capture these events via APIs or change data capture (CDC) mechanisms and send them to the HR RG for near-real-time ingestion.
Governance and Compliance
1. Data lineage and audit trails
Microsoft Purview: Governs data classification, lineage, and metadata for the data residing in the Azure Fabric environment. It can trace data movement and transformations within Fabric and its connections to external sources like SAP.
SAP ALM and Integration Suite logs: Auditing starts within the SAP applications and Integration Suite. Logs from these tools would contain information about who and what initiated data changes.
End-to-End Traceability: The combination of SAP logs and Purview's lineage tracking provides a full audit trail. For compliance, an auditor could link a final dataset in the gold layer of HR RG back through the Fabric pipelines and the SAP Integration Suite logs to the original SAP transaction.
2. Queensland Government compliance requirements
Hybrid architecture: This likely reflects a strategic decision to leverage existing SAP investment while benefiting from Azure's agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The Queensland Government Enterprise Architecture (QGEA) guides technology choices across agencies, and the hybrid model likely aligns with these standards, including those related to data security and interoperability (like IS18:2018).
Data Sovereignty: The use of a Microsoft Azure-based HR RG, provisioned by an Australian partner (Data#3), helps meet local data sovereignty requirements by keeping sensitive HR data within Australian Azure regions.
Vendor Choice: The hybrid approach avoids vendor lock-in and enables the DoE to select best-of-breed services for different functions.
3. Microsoft Purview across the SAP-to-Fabric boundary
Purview's Role: Purview's primary role is to track data lineage within the Microsoft Fabric environment. It relies on data connectors and metadata extraction to build its lineage map.
Cross-boundary Lineage: Purview does not inherently track lineage inside SAP systems. The link between the two ecosystems is documented through the configuration of the data integration pipelines (e.g., Data Hub and Dataflows) within Azure DevOps. Purview would understand the SAP system as the source for the data coming into Fabric.
Operational and Performance
1. Data latency requirements
Monitoring: SAP Integration Suite provides monitoring of integration flow performance and can detect latency issues during data transfer. Azure services like Azure Monitor are used to monitor the performance of the Fabric environment.
Latency Requirements: The requirements likely vary based on the data type. High-priority employee lifecycle events might have near-real-time requirements (sub-5 minutes), while bulk employee data or historical payroll data could tolerate hourly or daily batch transfers.
2. Peak load handling
SAP Scalability: SAP's cloud-based HXM suite (SuccessFactors) is designed to handle high-volume transactional workloads, including payroll processing.
Azure Elasticity: Microsoft Fabric and Azure DataHub leverage the elastic and scalable nature of the Azure cloud. Resources can be scaled up automatically during peak loads, such as the initial data migration or monthly payroll cycles, and then scaled down.
Parallel Payroll Run Testing (PPRT): The testing strategy explicitly includes a PPRT framework to ensure the new system can handle full payroll runs, which is a key indicator of its ability to manage peak load.
3. Failover strategy
SAP Platform: Cloud-based SAP systems generally have built-in high availability and disaster recovery plans, possibly using multiple availability zones or regions.
Azure Components: Azure services, including Fabric and Data Hub, are architected for high availability. For disaster recovery, Azure Site Recovery can orchestrate failover of on-prem components, and geo-redundancy features can protect data.
Hybrid Failover: The overall failover strategy would likely involve a coordinated plan to switch to redundant instances in a secondary region for both SAP and Azure components.
Future State
1. OpenText InfoArchive activation
Triggers: InfoArchive is typically activated to handle the archiving and long-term retention of historical data, most notably data from the decommissioned TSS platform. The activation will be triggered once the legacy TSS system is fully replaced and its data needs to be retained for compliance and future reference.
Migration Strategy: The strategy would involve a data migration project to extract the required data from TSS and ingest it into InfoArchive on Azure. This process is complex and often requires specialized tools like OpenText Migrate for a structured, repeatable migration.
2. SAP WalkMe and Microsoft Fabric integration
WalkMe's Role: WalkMe provides guided user experiences within the SAP applications (SuccessFactors, BTP, etc.).
Integration: WalkMe and Fabric do not directly integrate. WalkMe focuses on improving the user's experience within the SAP interface itself, while Fabric is the data platform used for analytics. Any reporting and analytics would likely be surfaced to users via Power BI, and WalkMe would guide them through the SAP transactional system. For reporting, a different tool, such as in-app guidance within Power BI, might be used.
