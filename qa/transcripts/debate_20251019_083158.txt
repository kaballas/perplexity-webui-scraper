Topic: E024 – AUTO TIME-OFF LEAVE PAYOUT ON TERMINATION
At DoE the practice of signalling your intent to terminate, often whole terms or months ahead of the actual
end date can be widespread. The amount of Fixed Term (Temporary) Teachers that finish at the end of the
school year also contribute to DoE needing to process a large number of terminations in a short
timeframe.
This extension seeks to address the issue of paying out leave on Termination within the last pay period the
employee is active with no interaction required from payroll
Current State
For the most part, Terminations in TSS are fully automated and don’t require administration or processing
from Payroll. However, in some cases, these could be involuntary termination (e.g. Redundancy) and
terminations raised via appointment some checking and loading of additional payment codes is required.
Additionally, Casual Terminations are automated if no entry has been lodged for 3 months (resignation
no/approval)
Future State - Out of The Box
Within ECP the standard process is to run the Termination Organiser, the Term Organiser in ECP is a
dedicated transaction code that processes the termination and is particularly useful for involuntary
terminations to calculate the appropriate ETP. That being said, for regular voluntary terminations, the ‘Auto
Termination’ is possible to change the status of an employee (or work assignment) to being Withdrawn.
Within ECP the alternative option also exists whereby an employee can be terminated via an Off Cycle
payment – this is common for exceptional circumstances such as Grievance or Death.
Enhancement Considerations
A couple of options can be considered for this enhancement and can be achieved by different BTP
solutions. The key consideration here is the termination needs to be completed in the normal manner in
EC – this could via an employee using Self-Service to Resign that is subsequently approved by their direct
manager or it could be entered directly via an appropriate administrator. Either way, the future dated
termination must exist in the system, this not only confirms the termination has been approved but also
allows the Principal clear line of sight with respect to the available teachers for the following Term /
School Year.
Typically, on termination, any leave balances that need to be paid out would get processed and paid out
as pay components and sent to ECP for processing – however in the case where the termination can
happen some months prior to the last day worked it’s important to not pay out any leave balances until
the pay period the employee is actually leaving.
One option is the extension utilises Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Essentially this is a bot, that
mimics the process that would be done by a human and pay out the leave and allow for the standard
process to pick up the cash out wage type and replicate to ECP. The downside of this particular option is
that product updates and unexpected browser issues can render the RPA process to error.

A more robust solution would be to utilise the API’s available and have the cashing up of time accounts,
the creation of the wage types and the zeroing out of the EC time accounts to occur through an
orchestration of the BTP Integration Suite.
Finally, the design must consider not only future dated terminations but also same day terminations and
retrospective (late) terminations.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
Determining which data point the system uses in order to cash out any remaining leave balances on
termination will determine the ultimate design. Initially the thought was this could be done at Event
Reason level, that is to say given certain Termination Reason codes require additional HR/Payroll
intervention (e.g. Redundancy) and others would not require the leave to be paid out (e.g. move to other
Queensland Gov Agency where the leave balance would be transferred with the employee). However, this
option would require the event reason itself to be hardcoded in the solution and would therefore require
ongoing maintenance as and when these reasons changed.
Instead, the proposal is to create a new data element in the Termination Leave Pay Out screen that would
dictate the payout of leave. In this case the flag would have 3 options:
1) Leave Balances are to be paid out
2) Leave Balances are to be cleared (no payout)
3) No Action
The setting or flag would be defaulted to 1) as in most cases the leave balances would be required to be
paid out irrespective of the reason. However, if required, the other 2 options could be set by the
administrator.
Note, for any self service (i.e. Voluntary) terminations, the setting would default to 1) and neither the
Manager (Approver) or the Employee (initiator) would have permissions to change this.
BTP Layer
Event Trigger
􀍻 Upon approval, all Termination Events entered into EC will be saved to a BTP table with the Event
timestamp, employee details, date of termination, and leave payout flag.
Event Processing
􀍻 Come the pay period the employee is terminating, the BTP extension will read the BTP table
saved in the above step to see if any processing of leave balances is required.
􀍻 For those required to be paid out in the current pay period, the following processing is required:
􀍻 Same Day or Retrospective Terminations
􀁸 In these cases, the leave balances will be accurate as the system will have accrued the leave
balance up until the last day worked. As such the remaining action is to mimic the standard UI
processing and save the leave balance for all appropriate time account types into a Pay
Component to be picked up by Time PTP Replication and zero out the balance
􀍻 Future Dated Terminations
Page | 238
􀁸 In these cases, there is a small window where the Termination date is in the current pay period but
after the time payroll is processed. As such, this scenario requires an additional step to the one
above which is to further accrue the leave balances out to the employee’s last day worked.
○
Employee Central Payroll
With this BTP Extension design, the only consideration outside of the normal Payroll Process, is the timing
of the run. This will need to be set up as a stand-alone program to allow integration within the Payroll
Control Centre payroll process as well as providing the ability to run on an ad-hoc basis.
Running on an ad-hoc basis supports special circumstance or off cycle processing.
