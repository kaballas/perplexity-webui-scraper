# Quality Assurance Review: Manage Organisation Design Module

## Executive Summary
As a senior SAP Quality Assurance Specialist, I have conducted a comprehensive review of the functional specifications and requirements analysis for the Manage Organisation Design module. The review assesses accuracy, relevance, clarity, and usefulness of the content against SAP best practices and internal governance models.

## 1. Accuracy Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- **Comprehensive Functional Coverage**: All 38 functional requirements (FR-1 to FR-38) are accurately captured with proper identification and priority classification
- **SAP SuccessFactors Alignment**: Correct identification of Foundation Objects (FO), MDF objects, and Position Management components
- **Technical Architecture**: Accurate representation of effective dating mechanisms and organizational hierarchy management

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Verification
- **ANZSCO Mapping Details**: FR-10 mentions "134311 – School Principal" as example, but verification needed for complete mapping requirements
- **Integration Specifications**: CIS integration details (FR-4) require more specific technical specifications
- **Payroll Integration**: Position-based allowance integration lacks detailed technical specifications

## 2. Relevance Assessment

### ✅ High Relevance Areas
- **Organizational Unit Management**: Core SAP SuccessFactors functionality directly applicable
- **Position Management**: Critical for Queensland DoE's organizational structure requirements
- **Effective Dating**: Essential SAP SuccessFactors capability for organizational changes
- **Bulk Operations**: Important for large-scale organizational changes (Machinery of Government)

### ⚠️ Moderate Relevance Concerns
- **Location-Based Allowances**: May require additional payroll system integration details
- **Concurrent Employment**: Complex scenario requiring detailed workflow specifications
- **Volunteer/Contractor Management**: May extend beyond standard Employee Central capabilities

## 3. Clarity Assessment

### ✅ Clear Elements
