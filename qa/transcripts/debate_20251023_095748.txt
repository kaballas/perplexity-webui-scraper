TASK: The Required Enhancement for Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------
CASUAL TIMESHEET EXTENSION
A Casual Timesheet is required to replace the Claims Portal utilised for school based casual work for nonteaching
positions. The key requirements are a user interface that will:
􀍻 Allow entry of Casuals with multiple assignments to enter time in a single timesheet
􀍻 Process School Based claims
􀍻 Non-Teacher Claims
􀍻 Casual Teacher Claims for schools not using Class Cover
Current State
For (predominately) school based Casual work not covered by any Relief Teacher process (i.e. Tracer /
Class Cover) DoE currently utilise the Claims Portal as part of the MyHR Portal:
The Claims Portal allows a business development manager to:
􀍻 Choose Org Unit (i.e. School)
􀍻 Search for Employee
􀍻 Add Time Based Entry (week-by-week, retro allowed up to 12 months)
􀍻 Defaults cost assignment based on School
○ Override available in certain scenarios (e.g. additional school or project funding)
􀍻 Enter hours day-by-day
􀍻 Employee Replaced (only applicable for some entries)
􀍻 Endorse v Pre-approved
○ The logged-on user can either be pre-approved or an endorser (further approval required).
􀍻 TSS applies logic based on:
􀍻 Org Unit – Is the location eligible for the allowance? (e.g District parity / special assistance)
􀍻 Allowance $ - Does the allowance have a default classification (pay scale level)?
○ Override available in certain scenarios (e.g. determine higher classification)
􀍻 Converts many allowances to HED-019 (CASUAL PAYMENT).
􀍻 Validates employee can’t receive same ‘daily’ allowance twice (i.e. through substantive & casual
engagements.

􀍻 Costing
i. Default Costing
ii. Region Based Costing
iii. Direct / Fixed Costing
Future State - Out of The Box
In standard SuccessFactors functionality, each Casual engagement can be set up as its own work
assignment, attached to its own position that inherits the appropriate cost assignment.
In this scenario either the Casual employee themselves, or a Manager / Administrator can enter timesheets
on behalf of.
For DoE, there is no self-service element, as the Business Manager (or equivalent) enters the time relevant
to the school or location. Given the future state position management model will be utilising mass
positions the solution needs to support Casuals working over multiple locations.
In addition, specific location and award interpretation is required that renders a need for an enhancement
that mirrors the current Claims Portal functionality.
Enhancement Considerations
Given the similarities between the Claims Portal and Class Cover, the design should take account of where
the award interpretation should occur to avoid duplication of effort.
The interpretation for Casual Timesheet Extension could happen embedded in the UI (BTP Application),
within the BTP layer or within ECP.
The benefit of doing the award interpretation in ECP is irrespective of where the data is coming from (i.e.
CTE or Class Cover)
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
No enhancement in EC directly is required, all enhancement required will occur in ECP and the BTP Layer.
That said, the BTP Application to enter Casual Timesheet will be available from the Employee Central
Homepage – this Home Page tile will be controlled by Role Based Permissions to only access to relevant
personas.
BTP Application
The BTP Application should mimic the current Claims Portal, specifically this allows for the logged in user
to:
􀍲 Select School
􀍲 Select Casual Worker
􀍲 Select Time Sheet Code
􀍲 Add Hours Per Day
Page | 243
􀍲 Select Employee Replaced
􀍲 Enter Cost / Location Overrides
􀍲 Save / Endorse / Draft
Workflow
The design will cater for logged on users with differing access. In some School locations the process
maybe to endorse the timesheet entries that require final approval, whilst other locations may operate a
pre-approved process.
Replication to Payroll
All approved entries will be replicated to payroll via Employee Time Based Remuneration (Infotype 2010).
For some payment types (e.g. Teacher Aide – First Aid Allowance) they will be passed directly to Payroll
and evaluated based on the allowance configuration tables. Other payment types, (e.g. Cleaner) will be
passed to Payroll for further award interpretation to determine whether further allowances (i.e. District
Parity) is applicable at that location.
Employee Central Payroll
Within ECP, the design needs to account for the valuation of the Infotype 2010 wage types passed from
the BTP Application. The design itself will most likely use the standard PTEX2010 staging table and run the
transfer to infotype program (CAT6) directly. The ability will always exist to run this program ad-hoc as
required.
Once in Payroll, the following interpretation is required:
􀍲 Allowance Valuation Based on Constant (T510K)
􀍲 Allowance Valuation Based on Pay Scale (T510S)
􀍲 Allowance Valuation Based on Pay Scale Override (T510S)
􀍲 Cost Distribution
The valuation of allowances will be marked accordingly in the ECP Workbook.

1	Introduction
1.1	Overview
Current Department of Education (DoE) System
In the current DoE system a claims portal is utilised for school based casual work for non-teaching positions.  Via a user interface the business manager can enter time and claims for casual non-teacher employees and casual teachers (where not using class cover).

SuccessFactors Standard Behaviour
By contrast, the standard behavior in SuccessFactors Time Off is to allow individuals to use timesheeting to makes claims.  But there is no school level basis for entering claims and due to the specific location and award interpretations required by DoE the standard functionality does not meet requirements.

Required Enhancement for Compatibility
The solution requires the ability for business development managers to enter claims and time against employees in their school.  This information should then be sent to ECP payroll to for interpretation and payment.  To fill this gap in the solution a BTP application is required to replicate the current claims portal and an integration is required to send this information to ECP payroll.  This same integration is also required to ingest the class cover integration when it becomes operation. This enhancement also allows a reduction in assignment creation for casual employees as currently to pay different awards for casual employees would require the creation of a new assignment for each award.  For the department this would create a large increase in assignments and administrative load.

1.2	Assumptions
To maintain flexibility, the specification is designed to be language-agnostic, supporting various frameworks available on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).  The Department of Education (DoE) should collaborate with their Service Integrator to select the most suitable framework.  For optimal integration and user experience, we recommend adopting the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with an SAPUI5/Fiori-based user interface.
The Teacher ID in Class Cover is the assignment ID from SuccessFactors for the Casual employment.
Standard Payroll Processing can be used to determine payment amounts and other payments using standard configuration and data provided in the IT2010 record.

1.3	Dependencies
That class cover is operational before the integration is required in BTP.

2	System Design
2.1	High Level Design
Overview
The Casual Timesheet Extension (CTE) is a Business Technology Platform (BTP) application accessible from the SuccessFactors homepage for Business Development Managers (BDMs). The application streamlines timesheet management, claim submission, and payroll integration.
Data Retrieval
•	The CTE application retrieves school and employee data from SuccessFactors using OData API calls.
•	Payment type and costing configurations are stored in BTP tables, determining source and override functions for cost centers and classifications.
Claim Submission
•	Claims are saved in the CTE Header and Item tables within BTP.
•	BDMs can submit claims for payment after entering the required data.
•	The claim moves to the approver, the CTE approver table triggers an email notification to the designated approver (The manager can be found from SF via OData negating the table requirement).
•	Approvers can access the application to review, edit and approve the claim. (Note: Approver cannot approve an entry against themselves – this would require approval 1 up of the approver.)
Payroll Integration
•	CTE claim items are replicated to SuccessFactors ECP Payroll via BTP integration.
o	The integration uses the BAPI BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST to pass:Assignment ID,ECP wage ype,Date,Hours/number,Unit,Classification (pay scale group and level),Cost assignment details (cost center, school, location)
•	A logical system number and reference document link the CTE Item to the IT2010 entry in SuccessFactors.
•	Successful integration returns a reference number; failures return an error message, which is recorded in the CTE claim item.
Error Handling and Reprocessing
•	Claims with errors are displayed in the CTE application for payroll administrators.
•	Administrators can view and reprocess erroneous items.
•	The BAPI uses a staging table (PTEX) before loading data into IT2010.
•	The integration runs the program RPTEXTPT in ECP to insert records into IT2010.
•	Errors are logged in the integration log, and payroll administrators can monitor the PTEX staging area for issues.

2.3	BTP Application UI Design
The UI layer should be built using SAPUI5 for SuccessFactors compatibility.
The frontend features should be:
•	Area at the top of the page to select the school via an OData API call to Successfactors and a drop down on the Weeks Starting
•	Then a table is presented with the detailed fields and actions on it
•	Confirmation and error message area.
Detailed UI Elements
Element	Description	Location
School	Select the School for the claims to be against	Above table
Week Starting 	Dropdown with start dates of the last 52 Weeks	Above table
Search Button	Button to filter table entries	Above table

Approve	Approves the CTE claim and submits it to ECP for 	For Approvers
Delete	Delete the CTE claim item	If the claim has already been replicated to ECP deletion this is not possible.  Make the button inactive when this is the case
Resend	Resends the CTE claim item via the BTP Integration to ECP.	Only available to payroll admins when an item is in Error
Overrides	Allows classification and cost center to be displayed and override entries if allowed via config.  This is via a pop up screen on the app.	The screen shows the default cost center (from employee position or costing table) and default classification from the config table.  If override is allowed for either field then an extra field for input is shown.  Cost Center from EC OData API and Classification from config.
Employee Replace	Allow entry of the employee assignment that is being replaced.  This would be employee assignments restricted by the school selected.	This can be different for each day.  Pop shows Mon – Fri for employee.
Fav	Ability to set a line as a favorite.  This creates an entry in the BTP table pointing to the item as a favorite.  	When the user selects a school any favorites saved for that school should be displayed for a new claim week. (or via popup before displaying….)
Note: There are a number of business rules around how to find the correct classification for payment types that are loaded against an assignment that need to be determined.  This could be position based, payment type, previous payments for the assignment etc.  This needs to be determined for the build task.
No future dated claims are allowed to be submitted for approval (TBC).

2.5	BTP Integration
Overview
This integration leverages SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) to replicate CTE (Claim Time and Expense) claim items or Class Cover file data into SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll (ECP).  The core mechanism involves calling the BAPI BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST to stage data, followed by executing the program RPTEXTPT to load the data into Infotype 2010 (IT2010).
The integration handles data mapping, success/failure responses, linking via an external number, and error logging/updating in the CTE system. It supports reprocessing of failed items by payroll administrators through a dedicated view in the CTE application.
Key objectives:
•	Automate replication of claim items for payroll processing.
•	Ensure traceability between CTE items and ECP IT2010 entries.
•	Provide robust error handling and visibility for administrators.
Components Involved
•	Source System: CTE application (holds claim items) or Class Cover.
•	Integration Platform: SAP BTP (orchestrates the flow, e.g., via Cloud Integration or custom services).
•	Target System: SuccessFactors ECP Payroll (uses BAPI for staging and program for loading).
•	Key SAP Objects:
o	BAPI: BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST (for inserting data into a staging table).
o	Program: RPTEXTPT (run in ECP to process staged data into IT2010).
o	Infotype: IT2010 (final destination for remuneration specifications).
•	Data Elements Passed:
Field	Description	Source
Assignment ID	Unique identifier for the employee assignment.	CTE Claim Item
ECP Wage Type	Payroll wage type code.	CTE Claim Item
Date	Effective date of the claim.	CTE Claim Item
Hours/Number	Quantity (e.g., hours worked).	CTE Claim Item
Unit	Unit of measure (e.g., hours, days).	CTE Claim Item
Classification	Pay scale group and level.	CTE Claim Item
Cost Assignment	Cost center, school, and location details.	CTE Claim Item
Ref Doc	Generated linking number (for CTE-IT2010 traceability).	Generated/Returned by Integration
Logical System	Ext System – Separate CTE and ClassCover	BTP Constant
Integration Flow (High-Level Steps)
1.	Trigger: The integration is initiated when a CTE claim item is submitted for replication (e.g., via API call).  Or when Class Cover file is received and uploaded into BTP.
2.	Data Extraction and Mapping:
o	Extract claim item data from CTE or Class Cover file.
o	Map fields to BAPI input parameters (e.g., assignment ID to employee/pernr, wage type, date, etc.).
o	Generate a reference number for linking.
o	Set the Logical system dependent on whether this is called by CTE or Class Cover.
3.	BAPI Call:
o	Invoke BAPI_PTMGREXTREMSPEC_INSWCOST via BTP (e.g., using RFC or OData adapter).
o	Pass mapped data to insert into the ECP staging table.
o	Handle BAPI response: If successful, hold the reference number; if failed, capture error message.
4.	Data Loading:
o	If BAPI succeeds, trigger the program RPTEXTPT in ECP (e.g., via RFC).
o	This processes the staged data into IT2010.
5.	Response Handling:
o	On success: Return the reference document to CTE and update the claim item record.  For class cover log the success against with the reference document.
o	On failure (at BAPI or program stage): Return error message to CTE, update the claim item, and log the error in the integration log (e.g., BTP monitoring logs).
6.	Error Visibility and Reprocessing:
o	Failed items appear in a dedicated view within the CTE application.
o	Payroll administrators can review errors and manually reprocess items (triggering the integration again).
Error Handling
•	Types of Errors:
o	Validation errors (e.g., invalid wage type).
o	BAPI failures (e.g., staging table insertion issues).
o	Program execution errors (e.g., data not loaded into IT2010).
•	Logging: All errors are captured in BTP integration logs for auditing and debugging.
•	Recovery: CTE updates ensure errors are visible; reprocessing allows admins to retry without data loss.
•	Notifications: Optionally, configure BTP to send alerts (e.g., via email or integration with monitoring tools) for persistent failures.
•	Assumptions and Considerations
•	Authentication: Use secure connections (e.g., OAuth or certificates) between BTP and ECP.
•	Performance: Batch processing for multiple claim items to optimize BAPI calls.
•	Monitoring: Leverage BTP's integration monitoring for real-time status and logs.
•	Testing: Validate end-to-end flow, including edge cases like partial successes or network failures.

Generate a TODO list of Fact check Task for the above specification.TODO List for Fact Check Task:

for example:

## 1. Accuracy Assessment

**Major Concerns:**
Your functional spec contains several **factually incorrect assumptions** about the system architecture:

- **Retroactive Processing**: You've assumed a 12-month retro window exists, but the context shows retroactive processing is enabled for "all vacation payment types" without specifying duration limits. This could lead to system performance issues and compliance violations.

- **Award Interpretation Location**: You've stated award interpretation could happen in multiple locations but haven't specified where it actually occurs. The context mentions T510K/T510S configuration rules, indicating this happens in ECP, not BTP.

- **Integration Flow**: Your data flow (EC → BTP → ECP → Payroll Result) is oversimplified. The context shows EC Self-Service connects directly to vacation hour projection, bypassing BTP for some processes.

**Suggestion**: Verify all technical assumptions against actual system capabilities before documenting.
