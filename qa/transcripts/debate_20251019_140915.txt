[User Feedback]
Many mobility actions within the Australian Public Sector (e.g. Secondment, temporary assignment, Fixed Term hires, Higher Duties) require an end action to be created as soon as the start action is created to identify the person returning to their substantive position at the end of the period. Standard SAP only suppports a subset of these actions creating the end action automatically.

HCMS-Specific Notes:  
The analyzed metadata extraction aligns precisely with SAP SuccessFactors and MDF extension standards, ensuring full temporal control and detailed override tracking critical for internal secondment management in the Queensland Department of Education HCMS hybrid SAP and Azure environment. These configurations support integration via OData APIs to Microsoft Azure Fabric, enabling secure, auditable, and consistent HR data flows to payroll and downstream systems. Role-based security and workflow compliance fulfill IS18:2018 and IPOLA cybersecurity mandates. Secondment lifecycle tracking using custom MDF with workflow and override flags is standard, but the note about standard SAP automatically creating end actions only for some mobility cases indicates a necessary custom development or workaround for full Australian Public Sector compliance. This should be addressed explicitly in cutover and parallel runs to prevent payroll and HR discrepancies.
