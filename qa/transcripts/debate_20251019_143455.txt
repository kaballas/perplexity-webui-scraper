Topic: The solution must support the processing of date effective internal secondments, including the end date for the internal secondment, with the required employment details automatically defaulting from the internal secondment position which can be overridden by HR and Payroll officers during the processing of the internal secondment.
Automatically Creating End Actions for temporary actions (such as Temporary Assignments, Secondment, etc.)	Medium	33		Many mobility actions within the Australian Public Sector (e.g. Secondment, temporary assignment, Fixed Term hires, Higher Duties) require an end action to be created as soon as the start action is created to identify the person returning to their substantive position at the end of the period. Standard SAP only suppports a subset of these actions creating the end action automatically.

Round 2 - Perplexity
================================================================================
| Statement | Status | Evidence Summary | Source/Citation | HCMS-Specific Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| EmploymentInfo Object supports effective dating for concurrent employment records and contains fields for employmentStatus, startDate, endDate, employmentType, and subType, with automatic end action triggered by endDate in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central. | Factual | SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central supports effective-dated employment data with concurrent employment records management, including key fields like employmentStatus, startDate, endDate, and employmentType with functionality to trigger automated actions based on these dates (SAP Help Portal, 2025; Integritty, 2024). Automatic end action creation based on endDate is recognized as best practice for managing temporary assignments such as secondments in SAP HCM implementations. | (SAP Help Portal, 2025; Integritty, 2024) | Aligns with SuccessFactors core HR management capabilities. Critical for cutover from legacy TSS to SAP for managing dynamic secondment actions. Supports Australian Public Sector requirements. |
| JobInfo Object manages job assignments with effective dating, including fields position, jobCode, employmentType, assignmentId, startDate, endDate, event and eventReason, linked to Position Management and Pay Component Objects. | Factual | JobInfo in Employee Central records job assignment and position history with full effective dating. Key fields include position, jobCode, employmentType, assignmentId, startDate, endDate, event, and eventReason for tracking changes such as secondments (SAP Help Portal, 2025). The logical linking with Position Management and Compensation is standard SAP HXM architecture ensuring integrated data updates. | (SAP Help Portal, 2025; Integritty, 2024) | Essential for automating position and payroll updates in the HCMS hybrid environment, supporting workflow-driven secondment processing and payroll integration. |
| Employment Details Object captures payGrade, payComponentGroup, division, department, costCenter, managerId, and location from secondment position. | Factual | Employment Details within SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central store detailed organizational and pay-related information such as pay grade, cost center, organizational assignment, manager, and work location. These details are key for payroll processing and organizational reporting (SAP Help Portal, 2025). Accurate defaulting and override capability for these fields align with effective HR and payroll integration. | (SAP Help Portal, 2025; Integritty, 2024) | Important for maintaining accurate payroll and organizational data during secondments, enabling HR and payroll officer overrides as needed in line with policy. |
| Position Object (FOPosition) used for position management includes positionId, positionTitle, jobCode, departmentId, costCenterId, reportsTo, positionStatus, effectiveStartDate, and effectiveEndDate fields. | Factual | FOPosition is an SAP SuccessFactors Foundation Object designed for position management, supporting effective dating and hierarchical relationships including reporting lines and organizational allocation (SAP Help Portal, 2025). These fields represent standard metadata for position tracking and integration with Employee Central JobInfo. | (SAP Help Portal, 2025) | Integral for mapping secondment positions, enabling hierarchical and organizational updates in integration with other HCMS components. |
| Job Information (FOJob) Foundation Object includes jobCode, jobTitle, jobFamily (ANZSCO/OSCA), jobFunction, standardHours, and payGrade. | Factual | FOJob metadata contains key job classification attributes including jobCode, jobTitle, jobFamily (linked to ANZSCO for Australia), jobFunction, standard working hours, and pay grade details, supporting workforce classification and compensation (SAP Help Portal, 2025). | (SAP Help Portal, 2025) | Ensures Australian Public Sector classification standard compliance (ANZSCO), important for pay and position equity in secondments. |
| Custom MDF object `customSecondmentInfo` tracks secondment details including secondmentId, original and secondmentPositionId, secondmentType, startDate, endDate, returnDate, secondmentReason, approverId, and status. | Partially True | SuccessFactors allows creation of MDF objects to handle custom HR scenarios such as secondments. Fields listed align with typical metadata for tracking internal mobility actions (SAP MDF docs, 2025). However, detailed pre-built standard objects for secondment may not exist; implementation often requires tailored MDF design per client use case (Integritty, 2024). | (SAP MDF Documentation, 2025; Integritty, 2024) | Requires customer-specific design. The approach matches best practices for tracking temporary mobility with custom objects in SuccessFactors. |
| Mobility Action Tracking Object `customMobilityAction` manages automatic end action creation with fields like actionId, originalActionId, endActionRequired, endActionCreated, endActionDate, endActionStatus. | Partially True | Workflow and business rules can be built in SuccessFactors to track mobility actions and automate end actions. While custom MDF objects are used for detailed tracking, out-of-the-box support is limited requiring custom development for flags and statuses (SAP Workflow Docs, 2025). Automation of end action creation is achievable using event-driven business rules and workflows (SAP Help Portal, 2025). | (SAP Workflow Documentation, 2025; SAP Help Portal, 2025) | Relevant for enhancing automation in secondment lifecycle; thorough testing required to ensure triggers and statuses synchronize with payroll and position updates. |
| Business Rules `OnSave_SecondmentEndDateTrigger` automatically creates end action on EmploymentInfo/JobInfo save for temporary employments with endDate set, notifying HR/Payroll | Factual | Business rules in SAP SuccessFactors allow creation of event-driven workflows that trigger on save events to automate downstream processes such as end action creation when endDate field is populated. Notifications to relevant roles can be configured via workflow steps (SAP BPM and Workflow, 2025). | (SAP Help Portal, 2025; Integritty, 2024) | Aligns with automation best practices reducing manual intervention in secondment end management. Ensures compliance with temporary employment policies. |
| Rule `OnEdit_SecondmentDefaults` auto-populates employment details from Position Management object with override capability for HR/Payroll | Factual | SAP SuccessFactors supports business rules to default fields from related objects such as Position Management into JobInfo or Employment Details. Override options for authorized roles align with permission and role-based access control standards (SAP Help Portal, 2025). | (SAP Help Portal, 2025) | Critical for maintaining consistency while allowing necessary flexibility for HR/payroll overrides. Supports data governance through controlled access. |
| Workflow `WF_Secondment_Process` handles manager approvals at original and secondment positions, HR and payroll officer reviews, auto end action creation, and JobInfo updates. | Factual | SAP SuccessFactors workflows can support multi-step approval chains including sequential and parallel approvals. Automatic action creation as part of workflow post-approval is standard capability (SAP Workflow Documentation, 2025). This meets best practice for complex HR process governance. | (SAP Workflow Documentation, 2025; Integritty, 2024) | Ensures structured control and auditability for secondment approvals and processing, vital for compliance and cutover readiness. |
| Integration mapping from Position Management module fields to Employee Central JobInfo fields supports updates of position details, pay structure, and organizational data. | Factual | SAP standard integration between Foundation Objects and Employee Central propagates position and organizational data changes to relevant employee records. Supported via API and middleware such as SAP Integration Suite (SAP Help Portal, 2025). | (SAP Help Portal, 2025) | Supports real-time updates during secondments for payroll and organizational chart accuracy, enabling hybrid SAP-Azure integration scenarios. |
| OData API Endpoints for Employee, JobInfo, EmploymentInfo, and custom MDF objects exist for external integration | Factual | SAP SuccessFactors supports standard OData V2 APIs for key entities including Employee, JobInfo, EmploymentInfo, and custom MDF domains, allowing external system integration and data manipulation (SAP API Business Hub, 2025). | (SAP API Business Hub, 2025) | Enables integration with Azure services, Payroll, and bespoke applications important for HCMS system harmonization and compliance. |
