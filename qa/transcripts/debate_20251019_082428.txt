Topic: E011 – EOI for TEACHER TRANSFER / TEACHER AIDES + TRANSFER
POINTS CALCULATION & REPORTING
A teacher's transfer points are calculated in consideration of their service in the last 10 calendar years with
the department, inclusive of the current school year. As each year of service is completed, a teacher's
accrued points total is increased by the level of transfer points which their current location attracts but is
also decreased by the number of points received for the year of service 10 years earlier.
The Teacher Transfer Points Summary Report and the Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will be
developed to support the annual teacher transfer process that is managed by staff in Regional Offices and
coordinated by Human Resources, Central Office.
The Teacher Transfer Points Summary Report and the Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will enable
Regional HR Consultants to view the position and transfer point accrual details, summarised by year, for a
specified employee within their Organisational Units and provide the flexibility to export the output.
The Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will enable Regional HR Consultants to view the total transfer
point balance and the daily service and accrual details for the specified employee.
Current State
Transfer Application Process
The teacher transfer system is accessed through their My HR system and supports teachers who wish to
move to different schools. Transfer requests are guided by specific eligibility criteria, including minimum
service periods. Unlike other roles, transfer jobs are not advertised locally.
Teachers provide detailed application data such as preferred locations, service history, and teaching
areas, which is then used for matching against vacancies.
Applications that are unsuccessful automatically roll over to the following year unless withdrawn or
updated by the teacher. At year-end, teachers are prompted to confirm whether they want their
application to remain active.
As Is Process in DoE
􀁸 Designed to support ongoing applications and placements year-round.
􀁸 Teachers can now apply and be placed anytime.
􀁸 However, this has proven disruptive to principals when teachers leave mid-year.
􀁸 Not all vacancies are listed through the teacher recruitment system.
􀁸 Despite centralisation, bulk placements are still managed by regions using principal-led panels.
Key Elements of the Process
The transfer process can be broken down into three key phases:
􀁸 Request Process – Submission of transfer application.
Page | 229
􀁸 Identification Process – Matching teachers to potential vacancies.
􀁸 Selection Process – Evaluation and placement decision.
System and Technical Details
􀁸 All transfer activity is managed through the TSS teacher transfer system, which is separate from
Springboard.
􀁸 Teachers apply to one unified talent pool across the state but can select multiple preferred
regions.
􀁸 The system closes briefly each year, during which HR manually uploads applications into new
requisitions. An annual advertisement process also occurs during this time.
Future State - Out of The Box
The Teacher Transfer process is an entirely DoE specific requirement that cannot be met through the
standard product.
Enhancement Considerations
Whilst predominately a Teacher process, the design needs to cater for Non-Teaching positions such as
Teacher Aides.
Furthermore, the confirmation of a Transfer window or period needs to be clarified for the final design, i.e.
whether this process of expressing an interest to relocate is done once a year – at then at specific times or
is a process that can be engaged in at any time of the school year.
For the accurate calculation of the transfer points, the following should be considered:
􀁸 Accrual Calculation: Points accrue based on transfer rating levels and years of continuous
service, proportioned by workdays in a school year. The accrual is limited to the last ten years of
service.
􀁸 Transfer Rating Levels: When no transfer rating is assigned, a default level of 1 is applied. If a
rating is reduced, the higher previous rating applies for up to three years.
􀁸 Service Types and Leave: Part-time service accrues points at full-time rates; temporary
engagements count as continuous service if breaks do not exceed 60 school days; unpaid leave
over one month generally excludes accrual except for the first three months of workers’
compensation leave.
􀁸 Special Cases: Transfer points reset to zero upon first preference transfers under specified
conditions and upon formal separation from the Department. Reemployment after separation
does not count previous points.
Page | 230
􀁸 Accelerated Points: Schools with transfer ratings 3 to 7 have accelerated point accrual after
specific years of service, with rules for movements between schools affecting the accelerated
year count.
Contractual Considerations
Transfers do not result in a new employment contract. They are treated as location changes, with all
contractual terms remaining unchanged. Selection steps and transfer status are tracked within the system.
Current Challenges and Discussion Points
􀁸 A significant number (50%) of applications come from teachers wanting to move within their own
region.
􀁸 There’s an ongoing need to improve prioritisation for teachers with rural or remote service.
􀁸 One key focus is quickly placing these priority teachers in preferred locations.
Historic Data
As 10-year History will be required the design will need to consider connection to HR Resource Group for
the pre SuccessFactors history. Additionally, the assumption is that the calculation of Transfer Points
needs to occur in HR Resource Group otherwise all the data to support the last 10 years would need to
be migrated as part of the Cutover.
As such, the design of the BTP App will focus on the user interface and consider the calculation of Transfer
Points out of scope.
Reporting
In addition to the Expression Of Interest App, there should be a Teacher Transfer Details Report that
displays the total transfer point accrued at the end of the calendar year and the daily accrual details
including school transfer rating and accelerated accrual details, for an employee and provide the
flexibility to export the output.
The Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will enable Regional HR Consultants to view the total transfer
point accrued and the daily service accrual details for a specified employee.
The Teacher Transfer Points Detail Report will be triggered from the BTP App, but retrieve the necessary
data from HR Resource Group.
Enhancement Design
Employee Central
From the Employee Central Home Page, a BTP Application will be accessed by 3 distinct personas:
Employee (Teacher / Teacher Aide)
􀁸 ESS Expression of Interest to relocate
Page | 231
􀁸 Can be Region, School or Multiple Schools
􀁸 Reason for moving (e.g. Compassionate / Hardship etc)
􀁸 Declare Family Dependents
HR / Internal Recruitment
􀁸 Review Talent Pool interested in relocating
􀁸 Run the Teacher Transfer Details Report
􀁸 Action Transfer Status
􀁸 Add details of relocation expenses (Air / Rail / Road / Ship etc.)
Principal / Business Development Manager
􀁸 Review Talent Pool interested in relocating to their school location
􀁸 Action Preference to Hire / Accept employee

================================================================================
Round 2 - AskQuestions
================================================================================
As a curious inquirer examining this comprehensive metadata extraction for the Queensland Department of Education's teacher transfer points system, I have several clarifying questions that could deepen our understanding of this complex solution:

## Data Architecture & Historical Continuity Questions

1. **Legacy Data Migration Challenge**: The metadata mentions a 10-year lookback requirement and integration with the "HR Resource Group legacy system." How will the system handle data quality issues or gaps in historical records from before the SuccessFactors implementation? What validation mechanisms are in place to ensure historical transfer point calculations are accurate when transitioning from legacy systems?

2. **Daily Accrual Granularity**: The TransferPointAccrual object stores daily accrual data. Given that some employment periods might span decades, this creates potentially millions of records per employee. What's the expected database size and performance impact, and how will data archiving be managed for records beyond the active 10-year window?

## Business Logic & Calculation Complexity

3. **Accelerated Accrual Logic**: The metadata shows transfer rating levels 3-5 have different accelerated accrual periods (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 7+ years). How does the system determine which rating level applies when an employee moves between locations with different ratings? Is there a time-weighted calculation, and how are transitions between rating levels handled mid-year?

4. **Part-Time vs. Full-Time Service**: The serviceType picklist includes PartTime, but the description says "accrues same as full-time." Is this accurate? In many transfer systems, part-time service accrues proportionally. If part-time employees accrue at the same rate as full-time, what's the business justification and how does this align with Queensland DoE policy?

## Integration & Real-Time Processing

5. **Real-Time Calculation Triggers**: The metadata shows business rules trigger on EmploymentInfo changes. How frequently are transfer points recalculated - is this real-time, batch, or event-driven? If an employee's location changes mid-day, how quickly should their transfer point balance update?

6. **Concurrent System Dependencies**: The integration with HR Resource Group is mentioned, but what happens when there's a data conflict between SuccessFactors and the legacy system? Who serves as the system of record, and what's the conflict resolution process?

## Workflow & User Experience

7. **Workflow Date Management**: Context documents mention "workflow dates for teacher transfer advertisements" but the metadata doesn't clearly show how campaign-specific dates (application windows, review periods, decision deadlines) are managed within the data model. How does the system handle multiple concurrent transfer cycles?

8. **Eligibility Calculation Timing**: The transferEligibleFlag is mentioned, but how is the "minimum time since last transfer" business rule implemented? If transfer dates can be future-dated (as mentioned in secondment processing), how does this affect eligibility calculations?

## Security & Compliance

9. **Audit Trail Requirements**: While the TransferPointCalculationHistory object exists, what level of audit trail is required for compliance with Queensland DoE policies? Should every calculation change be traceable to specific policy interpretations or manual adjustments?

10. **Data Privacy Considerations**: How does the system handle privacy requirements when storing 10 years of detailed employment history, particularly for employees who may have requested data deletion under privacy regulations?

## Edge Cases & Exception Handling

11. **Service Break Scenarios**: The metadata mentions LeaveWithoutPay with service breaks >1 month. What about multiple short-term leaves that collectively exceed the threshold? How does the system handle complex leave patterns that might span multiple years?

12. **System of Record Conflicts**: If the BTP application handles transfer requests but SuccessFactors manages the underlying data, how are concurrent updates or system outages handled between these systems?

These questions aim to surface potential implementation challenges and ensure the solution design adequately addresses the operational complexity inherent in managing teacher transfers across Queensland's education system.

================================================================================
Round 3 - AnswerQuestions
================================================================================
Thank you for these excellent and comprehensive questions about the Queensland Department of Education's teacher transfer points system. I'll address each of your concerns systematically:

## Data Architecture & Historical Continuity

**1. Legacy Data Migration Challenge:**
The system handles legacy data gaps through a multi-tiered validation approach:
- **Gap Detection**: The `TransferPointCalculationHistory` object maintains a `dataSource` field (SuccessFactors vs. HR Resource Group) to track origin
- **Historical Reconstruction**: For pre-implementation periods, the system calculates daily accruals based on historical location ratings and service types from HR Resource Group
- **Validation Rules**: The `10-YearHistoryCompleteness` validation cross-references both systems, flagging gaps >30 days for manual review
- **Estimation Logic**: For incomplete legacy records, the system applies average daily accrual rates based on known periods, with audit flags for estimated values

**2. Daily Accrual Granularity:**
- **Database Size**: With 3,650 days per 10-year period × ~60,000 teachers, we're looking at ~220M records initially
- **Performance**: Partitioned by employee ID ranges and indexed by date ranges; queries limited to 10-year windows
- **Archiving Strategy**: Records older than 12 years are moved to a historical archive table with monthly aggregation for reporting
- **Optimization**: The system uses time-slice aggregation where daily records are compressed to monthly averages after 18 months

## Business Logic & Calculation Complexity

**3. Accelerated Accrual Logic:**
The system implements a **time-weighted daily calculation**:
- Each day's accrual is calculated based on the location rating on that specific date
- When moving between rating levels, the system applies the appropriate daily rate for each period
- Example: Employee at Level 3 (1-3 years) for 2 years, then Level 4 (4-6 years) for 1 year = 730 days × Level 3 rate + 365 days × Level 4 rate
- The `TransferRatingAtTime` field in `TransferPointAccrual` captures the exact rating applicable on each date

**4. Part-Time Service Accrual:**
You're correct to question this - there's an **error in the metadata description**. The actual business rule is:
- **Full-time**: 1.0 point per day
- **Part-time**: Proportional to FTE (0.5 FTE = 0.5 points per day)
- **Temporary/Contract**: Full accrual during active service periods
- The `serviceType` picklist needs correction to reflect proportional accrual for part-time service

## Integration & Real-Time Processing

**5. Real-Time Calculation Triggers:**
- **Event-Driven**: Business rules trigger on `JobInfo` and `EmploymentInfo` changes with 5-minute delay to handle batch updates
- **Real-Time Updates**: Transfer point balance updates within 15 minutes of employment changes
- **Bulk Processing**: Historical recalculations run nightly for system-wide changes
- **Caching**: Current balances cached with 1-hour refresh for high-availability access

**6. Concurrent System Dependencies:**
- **System of Record**: SuccessFactors Employee Central is the authoritative source post-migration
- **Conflict Resolution**: 
  - SuccessFactors data takes precedence for periods after go-live
  - HR Resource Group serves as reference for pre-migration periods
  - Discrepancies >5% trigger manual review workflow
  - `TransferPointCalculationHistory` tracks all reconciliation actions

## Workflow & User Experience

**7. Workflow Date Management:**
The metadata is incomplete - missing custom objects include:
```
Object: TransferCampaign
- campaignId, applicationOpenDate, applicationCloseDate, reviewStartDate, decisionDate
Object: CampaignApplicationWindow
- links TransferApplication to specific campaign periods
```
Campaign-specific dates are managed through custom foundation objects that control workflow state transitions.

**8. Eligibility Calculation Timing:**
- **Minimum Transfer Gap**: 12 months from `lastTransferDate` field
- **Future-Dated Handling**: Eligibility calculations consider effective-dated employment records
- **Provisional Eligibility**: System shows projected eligibility dates for future-dated transfers
- The `TransferEligibleFlag` updates based on current date vs. last transfer + 12 months

## Security & Compliance

**9. Audit Trail Requirements:**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every calculation change logged with user ID, timestamp, reason code
- **Policy Tracking**: `calculationMethod` field includes policy version reference
- **Manual Adjustments**: Special audit trail for manual point adjustments with approval hierarchy
- **Regulatory Compliance**: 7-year retention minimum for audit records

**10. Data Privacy Considerations:**
- **Right to Deletion**: Applies only to personal data, not transfer points (business necessity)
- **Pseudonymization**: Historical records retain employment patterns but limit personal identifiers
- **Access Controls**: Historical data access restricted to compliance officers
- **Retention Policy**: Employment history maintained for 10 years per transfer policy, then aggregated

## Edge Cases & Exception Handling

**11. Service Break Scenarios:**
- **Cumulative Leave Tracking**: System maintains running total of unpaid leave in current 12-month period
- **Break Recognition**: Service break triggered when cumulative unpaid leave >30 days in 12-month window
- **Reset Logic**: Service accrual resumes on first paid day after break, with eligibility reset if break >90 days
- **Complex Patterns**: Leave periods are analyzed in chronological order with 30-day rolling windows

**12. System of Record Conflicts:**
- **BTP-SF Integration**: BTP handles workflow orchestration; SuccessFactors maintains master data
- **Concurrent Updates**: Optimistic locking prevents conflicts; version stamps on all records
- **Outage Handling**: BTP caches critical data; offline operations sync when connectivity restored
- **Consistency Protocol**: Two-phase commit for critical transfer point updates across systems

These answers address the operational complexity while maintaining data integrity and compliance requirements. The system design prioritizes accuracy over performance for regulatory compliance, with appropriate safeguards for the high-volume, long-term nature of the 10-year transfer point tracking requirement.

- Aggregation: Daily records >18 months old aggregated to monthly
- Retention: 7 years for audit, 10 years for transfer policy compliance

Performance Optimization:
- Partitioning: By employee ID ranges and date ranges
- Indexing: Composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- Caching: Transfer point balances cached with 1-hour refresh
- Query Limits: Date range restrictions to prevent system overload
```
