SAP recommends migrating to more secure methods for generating SAML assertions or using alternative authentication protocols like OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0, which are more secure and modern standards.\n\n### Replacement Options and Migration Steps\n- SAP encourages moving away from the /oauth/idp API to more secure, standardized OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect mechanisms for authentication and authorization. OIDC extends OAuth 2.0 with an identity layer, offering JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) which are easier and safer to use than SAML assertions.\n- An inventory of all existing integrations using /oauth/idp should be conducted to identify migration scope.\n- A detailed migration plan with clear deadlines targeting completion well before the deletion date of November 14, 2025, is critical.\n- Codebases and integration configurations must be updated to reference new OAuth 2.0 or OIDC endpoints instead of /oauth/idp.\n- Rigorous testing of the migrated integrations across all environments is essential to ensure stability and correct function.\n- Communicate clearly with all stakeholders and affected teams about the migration timeline, potential impacts, and completion criteria.\n- Monitor system performance and integration health post-migration until full deprecation.\n\n### Timeline and Risks\n- The hard cutoff date for the /oauth/idp API is November 14, 2025, not May 14, 2027.\n- Missing this migration deadline will cause integrations relying on the deprecated API to fail, leading to system outages or loss of authentication capabilities.\n- Early migration reduces the risk of disruption and allows for addressing unforeseen issues well before the cutoff date.\n\n### Summary Migration Checklist\n- Confirm a full inventory of API usage including clients relying on /oauth/idp.\n- Identify and adopt SAP-supported replacement methods, preferably OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.\n- Develop and communicate a comprehensive migration plan with phased deadlines.\n- Perform code updates and configuration changes to eliminate /oauth/idp usage.\n- Conduct thorough testing and validation in all environments.\n- Keep stakeholders informed and provide support during and after the transition.\n- Monitor until the deprecated API is fully removed by November 14, 2025.\n\nThis plan applies to the integration and extension product area handling the OAuth IdP API to ensure uninterrupted, secure operations post-deprecation.[1][3][5]", "processed": true}

Register custom extension attributes via Microsoft Graph API to extend the Entra ID user schema.  \n   - These extensions will hold user-specific data necessary for SuccessFactors mapping (e.g., employee ID, department).\n\n2. **Populate Extension Attributes for Users**  \n   -

Map Entra ID custom attributes to corresponding SuccessFactors user fields (e.g., mapping Entra’s extension attribute “extension_employeeId” to SuccessFactors employee ID).  \n   - Perform testing with sample users to verify accuracy.\n\n5. **Set Permissions and API Access**  \n   - Assign appropriate Microsoft Entra ID app permissions to allow APIs to read directory extensions (e.g., User.Read.All).  \n   - Confirm SuccessFactors connectors have API credentials and authorization to access Entra ID data.\n\n6. **Test and Validate User Data Flow**  \n   - Verify that updates in Microsoft 365 user profiles propagate to Entra ID extensions and reflect correctly in SuccessFactors user data.  \n   - Validate creation or updates of users in SuccessFactors based on mapped attributes.\n\n### Risks and Considerations\n\n- Extending the schema adds complexity and requires governance to avoid inconsistent data.  \n- Incorrect attribute mapping may cause data errors in SuccessFactors.  \n- API permission misconfigurations can block data access.  \n- Integration beyond directory extensions (e.g., workflows) is outside this scope and may require additional setup.\n\n***\n\nWould you like detailed examples of Microsoft Graph API commands for creating and managing directory extensions?", "processed": true}

Complete import execution.\n2. Event emission by Centralized services.\n3. Event propagation to listeners/subscribers.\n4. Follow-up processes triggered asynchronously.\n5. Follow-ups complete independently.\n\n# S5 VALIDATE\nCheck: Does this clearly describe where follow-ups are positioned? Yes. Are event handling points specifically identified? Yes. Checklist present? Yes.\n\n***\n\n### Checklist\n- [ ] Confirm follow-ups are event-driven triggers, not inline with imports.\n- [ ] Identify event types emitted after Job and Termination imports.\n- [ ] Configure event subscribers to these emitted events.\n- [ ] Position follow-ups as asynchronous listeners post-import.\n- [ ] Ensure cross-entity imports also trigger follow-ups via events.\n- [ ] Avoid embedding follow-ups inside import execution.\n- [ ] Verify setup via Centralized services event bus and documentation.", "research_report": "Follow-up processes after Job Information and Termination Details imports in an event-based system (Centralized services) are positioned as asynchronous event subscribers triggered by specific import completion events. The import execution itself completes first, then Centralized services publishes a corresponding event (e.g., **JobInformationImportCompleted**, **TerminationDetailsImportCompleted**). These events propagate through the centralized event bus, and configured event listeners subscribed to these event types independently trigger follow-up processes such as validations, recalculations, notifications, or cross-entity updates (including Compensation Information imports).\n\nThis positioning ensures follow-ups run outside the import execution flow, maintaining modularity, scalability, and decoupling. Developers or administrators configure event subscriptions on the Centralized services platform to attach the necessary follow-up handlers, which always run asynchronously after the event is received.\n\n### Follow-up Process Positioning Post-Import\n\n- Job Information and Termination Details imports emit completion events once successfully finished.\n- Centralized services event bus broadcasts these events system-wide.\n- Event listeners subscribed to these events trigger follow-up logic asynchronously.\n- Follow-ups may include recalculations, validations, notifications, and cross-entity updates.\n- Cross-entity updates (e.g., Compensation Information import) follow the same event-based trigger pattern.\n- Follow-up logic explicitly must **not** be embedded within the import batch execution.\n- Configuration is done on the Centralized services platform by registering event subscribers to relevant event types.\n\n### Summary of Event Flow for Follow-ups\n\n| Step                                        | Description                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

Event emission                            | Centralized services triggers corresponding event |\n| 3. Event bus propagation                     | Event is broadcast to all subscribers/listeners  |\n| 4. Asynchronous follow-up triggers           | Registered event listeners invoke follow-up processes |\n| 5. Follow-ups execute independently          | Follow-up logic runs without blocking import     |\n\n### Key Actions for Implementation\n\n- Confirm all follow-ups are triggered via event listeners, not synchronously inline.\n- Identify and subscribe to relevant import-completion event types (JobInformationImportCompleted, TerminationDetailsImportCompleted).\n- Ensure event listeners are configured in the Centralized services event framework.\n- Design follow-ups to handle time-consuming operations asynchronously.\n- Avoid embedding follow-ups in import logic to preserve system modularity.\n- Validate configuration and event flow through Centralized services documentation and event monitoring tools.\n\nThis approach fully leverages the event-based architecture of Centralized services, enabling reliable, scalable, and decoupled follow-up processing after Job Information and Termination Details imports.", "processed": true}

Identify the Name field entry, which holds the display name of the object.\n\n- **Assign Translated Values:**  \n  For each supported language, enter the translated value of the Name field. This step adds language-specific versions of the field label or value.\n\n- **Ensure Multi-Language Support in Metadata:**  \n  Confirm that in the Foundation object metadata, the Name field is flagged or configured to support translation (multi-language). Without this, the system will not retrieve alternate language versions.\n\n- **Verify User Preferred Language Settings:**  \n  Check that users have set their preferred language in their Employee Central user profiles. The system uses this setting to determine which translation to display.\n\n- **Confirmation via Process Automation:**  \n  When the Name field is accessed through Process Automation scenarios, the system looks up the user’s language preference and retrieves the appropriate translation from Employee Central automatically.\n\n- **Testing:**  \n  Log in as users with different preferred languages and verify that the Name field appears correctly translated according to each user's language setting.\n\n### Prerequisites and Considerations\n\n- The Name field must be enabled for translation in the object definition.  \n- Translation UI must have complete translations for all languages used by employees.  \n- User profiles must reflect correct preferred language settings.  \n- Process Automation retrieves translations seamlessly but relies on the setup done in Employee Central.  \n- Managing translations incurs maintenance effort but significantly improves usability in multilingual environments.  \n\n### Validation Checklist\n\n- Are Name field translations complete for all target languages?  \n- Are user preferred language settings configured and tested?  \n- Does the UI display the correct translation based on user language?  \n- Has the end-user experience been tested across supported languages?  \n- Is the configuration documented for future maintenance?  \n\nThis approach ensures the Name field displays in the preferred language of the user via the Translation UI, leveraging Employee Central configuration and Process Automation integration.", "processed": true}

Due to this change, all iOS users will be required to sign in again after updating the app—this is a mandatory reauthentication step to prevent access issues. The app's name and icon will remain unchanged despite this update.\n- These updates are part of a broader move to enhance security and improve the user experience on iOS.\n\nFor users with shared devices or multiple user profiles (Multi-Profile Mode):\n- Multi-Profile Mode now requires that all profiles on a device belong to the same company or instance as the device's Owner (the first activated user, also called the Admin User). Profiles from different companies will become invalid and must be removed.\n- The ability to assign nicknames to profiles has been removed. Instead, the user interface will indicate the Owner profile in a new way.\n- Profile removal is now restricted: only the Owner or the individual user can remove a profile. Profiles cannot be deleted directly from the Profiles screen; the Owner must go to Settings > Manage Profiles.\n- The previous “Shared Device” setting is discontinued. Passcode requirements and other security features formerly enabled by this setting now apply automatically when Multiple Profiles is activated.\n- Profile switching behavior on Android is aligned with iOS, requiring users to end their current session before another can begin. This promotes strict session isolation between users.\n\nGeneral security and usability impact include:\n- Improved session isolation to prevent cross-account access on shared devices.\n- Removal or expiry of cached credentials to avoid unauthorized access.\n- Enhanced activation and authentication flows tailored to comply with platform security standards and prepare for future capabilities like SAP’s AI copilot.\n\nUsers and organizations should communicate these changes clearly, prepare for mandatory reauthentication, and review usage of Multi-Profile Mode to ensure compliance with new restrictions and security improvements.\n\nReference: Official announcement from SAP dated February 18, 2025, and further details from Diokles (a SAP consulting resource) covering these updates and recommendations for action.[1][2]", "processed": true}
