{"Title": "SAP SuccessFactors Recruitement", "Description": "The solution must provide real time integration from Smart Jobs (https://smartjobs.qld.gov.au) for all applications received against a particular job advertisement.", "research_instructions": "<think>Objective: Provide a structured, blunt plan for real-time integration from Smart Jobs to SAP SuccessFactors Recruitment. Assumptions: Australian context; no access to Smart Jobs API details provided beyond URL. Plan: deliver a compact, auditable blueprint with deliverables and checks. Risks: API auth, rate limits, data mapping, privacy. Scope: Real-time ingestion of all applications for a given job ad. </think>\n\nS1 UNDERSTAND\n- Task: Design a real-time integration from Smart Jobs to SAP SuccessFactors Recruitment for all applications against a specific job advertisement. Constraints: Australian English; no external links in output; clear, actionable steps.\n\nS2 ANALYZE\n- Conflicts: Unknown Smart Jobs API specs, authentication, Webhook/Push vs Polling, data schema alignment.\n- Unknowns: Job ad identifier mapping, application event types, security requirements, latency SLAs.\n- Constraints: Real-time ingestion, single job advertisement scope, compliant data handling.\n\nS3 REASON\n- Decisions: Use a real-time event-driven approach via Smart Jobs webhooks if available; otherwise implement low-latency polling with incremental delta windows. Map fields to SuccessFactors candidate data model. Implement robust idempotency and deduplication. Enforce error handling and audit logging. Authenticate via OAuth 2.0 or API keys as supported. Ensure data privacy and regional compliance.\n- Trade-offs: Webhooks reduce latency but require endpoint availability; polling simplifies security but adds latency. Idempotent upserts increase reliability but require stable external IDs.\n\nS4 SYNTHESIZE\n\nArtifact: Implementation blueprint\n\n- Architecture\n  - Real-time path: Smart Jobs → API Gateway → Event Queue (e.g., Kafka) → SAP SuccessFactors Recruitment API.\n  - Fallback path: Poll Smart Jobs for changes every N seconds, with change tokens.\n  - Data flow: For each new application, create or update candidate in SuccessFactors; attach to corresponding requisition.\n- Data mapping (core fields)\n  - Applicant: firstName, lastName, email, phone, resume (URL or binary), coverLetter, inferred language.\n  - Job: jobId, title, location, department, recruitmentStage.\n  - Application meta: applicationId, appliedAt, source (Smart Jobs), status, attachments.\n- Security and Compliance\n  - OAuth 2.0 with scopes for candidate creation/read.\n  - Encrypt in transit (TLS) and at rest; store minimal PII; data retention policy.\n- Idempotency\n  - Upsert by externalApplicationId; deduplicate duplicates.\n- Error handling\n  - Retry with exponential backoff; dead-letter queue for failed messages.\n- Monitoring\n  - Real-time dashboards for latency, success rate, failure rate; alerting on SLA breaches.\n- Operations\n  - Versioned mapping, schema evolution plan, rollback procedure.\n- Deliverables\n  - 1) Connectivity blueprint; 2) Data mapping document; 3) API integration specs; 4) Error handling and retry policy; 5) Monitoring and alerting plan; 6) Test plan; 7) Runbook.\n\nChecklist\n- [ ] Real-time path defined with webhook or polling fallback.\n- [ ] Field mapping between Smart Jobs and SuccessFactors.\n- [ ] Authentication mechanism documented and implemented.\n- [ ] Idempotent upsert logic for applications.\n- [ ] Error handling, retries, and DLQ in place.\n- [ ] Monitoring, dashboards, and alerting defined.\n- [ ] Test plan covering end-to-end scenarios.\n\nS5 VALIDATE\n- Checklist included: Yes\n- Acceptance criteria: Real-time ingestion capability, correct field mapping, robust error handling, auditable logs.\n\nS6 DELIVER\n- Next actions: Confirm Smart Jobs API capabilities (webhook support, auth method).
